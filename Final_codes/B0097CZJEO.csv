1,A3NPT5455XR1C2,2014-05-11,1.0,78.0,82.0,4.0,16GB,wrong discreption.,they said on the title apple iphone 5 16gb white  unlocked used but what i received was not unlocked  and after contacting the seller they said in the description was written the phone is not locked. that doesnt make scene and consider as cheating. im extremely dissatisfied and that would be the last time to deal with you guys. i paid 379.98 for a phone has no value..
2,A2DU5IXJYDJBPS,2013-01-07,5.0,534.0,633.0,99.0,16GB,its an iphone....again.,warning my reviews are thorough  straight forward  and to the point...  i am and always will be an avid supporter of apple  despite their obscene prices  sometimes annoying level of arrogance in the world of marketing technology. say what you will about apple  there is no denying their superiority when it comes to the quality  capabilities of their products. when i picked up my first iphone in 2008 a 3gs  i fell in love with the simplicity of apple ios  just how easy it is to navigate. since then  ive owned the 4  the 4s   now the 5. at this point  needless to say  im accustomed to ios  trying to use phones with other operating systems like android  windows gives me the worst headache you could imagine.  now down to the dirty side of this review. yes  i gave the iphone 5 five stars. why because it does everything it claims to do. it has a slightly faster processor  slightly larger screen   better resolution than its predecessor. the screen quality  imho  is its best asset. i will not judge the quality of the phone by how much it costs like a large percentage of other reviewers  because it is completely irrelevant in making a fair assessment of the phone itself. besides that fact  it is pretty comparable in price to any other similar smartphone that you would buy outright without a contract. want an iphone but dont want to pay half a grand get a contract like i did  stop whining....  moving on to the dirty  this will probably be my last iphone purchase for a while. why as ive come to realize with age  shelling out 200 every single year over an upgrade to a phone that has had little to no significant changes is beyond ridiculous. most do it for the sake of saying they own the latest iphone. some do it for the sake of spending money. either way  my advice would be to not fall into the conformities of society. buy the 4s or 5 which are practically the same darn phone slap an otter box or other brand of thick protector on it itll live longer  trust me  vow to hold out until apple steps it up an acceptable amount of notches. and honestly  at this point in their game  i dont see that happening for a while. its a vicious money cycle with apple and ill be the first to say...i will not be buying the inevitable  sure to come iphone 5s at the end of the year. unless it can wash my clothes  cook my dinner   read me a bedtime story.....
3,A2FKOYADKXF4K0,2013-06-07,4.0,66.0,77.0,11.0,16GB,iphone 5 versus samsung glaxy s 4.,i recently switched to verizon and looked at multiple reviews to help me decide between the samsung galaxy s 4 and the iphone 5. i decided on the iphone but the person at the counter convinced me that the galaxy is a better phone and i took it home. i did have a problem in that the galaxy seemed to come on even though i turned it off at night. i went back and rather than get another s4 i decided to give the iphone a chance. so now i have experience with both.  firstly i use the phone for fairly basic bread an butter applications phone  texts  email  calendar  directions and basic apps like yelp  shazam and imdb. so lets go head to head  phone and sound quality this is the main reason i decided to stick with the iphone. even though some reviews suggest the sound quality was better with the s4  my experience was the opposite. though the s4 is louder i found the quality of the sound much better on the iphone. in fact my old s2 seemed to have a better sound quality than the s4. call me old fashioned but at the end of the day my primary use of this is still as a phone.  aesthetics the iphone hardware looks better but the aesthetics of the software interface was better on the samsung. in fact when i switched to the iphone i felt like i was going into withdrawals from the beautiful presentation and the home screens on the s4.  texting i like the iphone because i found the voice recognition slightly better. so now i voice most of my texts. i do miss swype when i have to type out my texts.swype is faster to type for me  email samsung does have the advantage of having different apps for my gmail account and my work email but the difference is superficial. some may actually like getting all your emails in one app better.  calendar and contacts one reason i was nervous about switching to iphone was that my calendar and contacts are google based. but the switch was quite easy as i could export my google contacts to the cloud pretty easily. and this way i only had to keep the contacts i use regularly and leave the rest on my g mail account. the calendar synchronized well though i miss the ultracool calendar snippets on the s4.  navigation now that google maps is on the iphone  no problems there. just downloaded the app.  overall the iphone strikes me as simpler  easier to navigate and sturdier with good voice quality. the s4 is more technologically advanced  more frills  better software interface but also with more bugs. s4 tends to heat up more too.  the kicker for me was the better voice quality and i am happy to stay with the iphone for now..
4,A10JYXBU0V4FOQ,2013-08-29,5.0,19.0,19.0,0.0,16GB,it works as what i imagined..,its unlocked but not brand new.. its good. the ios system is the best mobile system  i think. i love it..
5,AAT995CZFFNVD,2012-10-17,2.0,578.0,725.0,147.0,16GB,great phone  stupidly high price.,if you buy this phone on amazon or anywhere else for the 1000+ price tag  your just a fool. this phone is great  but only slightly better than the 4s which also runs ios6. the iphone 5 has a bigger screen which is useful  a slightly better processing chip  and thats about it. if you dont own an iphone  getting a 4 or 4s is a better deal since will cost you like 40% less but is only like 10% inferior to the iphone 5.  more importantly  on top of that  do you guys think apple is stupid they will soon enough come out with iphone 5 unlocked to sell at their stores. they are only selling it with carriers at the moment so the carriers can make money and therefore apple makes money because carriers pay apple to do that. but just like the iphone 4s  the iphone 5 will soon be sold unlocked at a retail price of about 650.00  be patient people  dont be desperate and overpay for an unlocked iphone 5  its a phone for crying out loud  a phone that will be worth half of what you bought it here for in less than a year  yes  believe that. dont be foolish..
6,A1Y1J4WQT2YSIT,2013-05-13,4.0,62.0,78.0,16.0,16GB,nice improvement over the 4s.,new features  everyone knows its lighter and slimmer. some love it  some think it makes it feel cheap. i carry my phone when i go biking  walking  or running  so i for one welcome the new design. i think the favorite thing for me about the new screen is that it can display an extra row of icons  which means your folders can fit more  and you can have more on one screen. i like to keep everything fitting on one page right there for me to access. the screen is brighter  and color saturation is noticeably better  blacks are blacker  colors are more rich. the phone has lte which means it will connect to networks faster  and it has 3 microphones  and noise canceling for better audio. the new earbuds are improved mostly in design  not sound quality i do wish it came in more colors  but black and white are essential choices  and will do. hopefully they will bring out more choices  at least red and silver.  os/interface  this is the ios you know and love. fundamentally the same  but with new features siri  panoramic photos  facetime over 3g some people complain that it hasnt changed enough since the first iphone. its essentially quite simple  which is the aesthetic that defines apple. how much has osx changed in the past 7 years not much either. if one wanted to change the style of the icons and fonts  they do have the option to jailbreak. what i like about ios is that theres only as many menus as there needs to be. with android you will see redundant menus  and see settings more than once in several menus. also i was peeved by the back button and the way it serves a different purpose depending on the context. will pressing it take you back to the apps main menu or will it close the app i dont know press it and find out the fact that they made the iphone work fundamentally with just the one home button is a feat of itself. widgets are cool to have  but i always ended up disabling them to conserve battery life and cut down cpu/ram usage. the notification menu  and icon badges suffice for quick indications.  apps  while both android and ios have far more apps than any human could sample in a lifetime  what matters most is quality  not quantity. iphone has all of the best apps at its disposal  many of which do not exist on android. games like infinity blade ii  sf volt  chinatown wars  fairway solitaire  music apps like animoog  dm1  ikaossilator  and rebirth  and essential apps like itunes u  pages  and imovie. when i switched to android  i found that there were a lot of great apps i missed that were not on google play store. since ive switched back to iphone 5  i did not notice any key apps that are on android but not on ios.  performance  the first thing i noticed on this new model is how snappy everything is. tasks are executed fast. launching apps  pages loading  switching through menus  it does it in a breeze. ios runs smoothly because its coded in c  while android is coded in java  which has a lot of inefficiencies. ive heard people complain of laggy performance even on the new s4. i believe the overhead of androids coding is creating a bottleneck  which is why even with a quad core snapdragon  you can still have performance issues. software is just as important  if not more important  than the hardware. my sams  universal content/sharing  i have an ipad  and imac. if i play a game of vice city on my ipad  i can continue on the same save on my iphone when i leave my house. if i made a note with some important info on my imac  ill have it on my ipad to refer to  no 3rd party apps needed. if i purchase a universal game  i get it on my phone and tablet. if i am having a text conversation with a friend on my iphone  i can continue on any other device and see all previous messages. photos and videos are shared among all the devices as well. i also like that i can facetime with all my friends and family who have an ios device. when i had an android phone  i couldnt get everyone to create skype accounts and get the app.  reliability/warranty  the iphone has been smooth sailing. with the two android phones  i had a handful of issues. the phone would often freeze  and i would have to restart. icons would disappear. keyboard input lagged. screen brightness would adjust itself  even though auto brightness was shut off. the only thing ive experienced is the occasional app crashing  which is often the coding of the app itself  not necessarily an iphone issue.  i like knowing that if i have an issue with the phone  i can go to my local apple store  and they will either fix it  or replace it with a new one there on the spot. with other manufacturers  they either contract their repairs to a 3rd party business  or they require you to go through the rma process  ship the phone to them  which can take weeks. if you have an issue that can be resolved over the phone  you will be surprised when you call apple support and have your call answered by a human being  whos a native english speaker from the united states.  other  being a musician  i like that you have the ability to plug in an instrument guitar  piano  bass and use recording  modeling  and effects apps  this opens you up to a whole world of music production. one of the deal breakers with android is that you cant connect a music instrument due to the latency inherent in the software maybe this will be resolved in the future. this means apps like garageband  ampkit  amplitube  jamup  nano studio  are not possible on android.  i also like the aluminum body  and the distinction that its currently the only phone thats not plastic. the htc one claims to  but its actually an overlay  fused with plastic. another thing i appreciate is the lack of bloatware. iphones come with a higher percentage of free space than android phones  and considering that some of the new android phones dont have sd card slots  its significant. some of them even have 7gb of used space out of the box. also  apple products have the highest resale value of any brand. if you do end up deciding to sell your phone in the future  you will get more for it.  drawbacks  screen is smaller than the competing phones no sd card slot for expanding storage camera not equal to some of the other top phones speakers pointing down is not a good design apple maps still has issues battery life could be better like all smartphones design could benefit from a refresh  also ios does not have a lot of the software features that the new android versions have. some of these features are useful  some of them are more of a novelty that look good on paper  and some you will probably never use. but its nice to have these options. being able to choose a different default browser  using hand gestures for phone functions  being able to do multiple attachments for emails  these are the more useful ones.  summary  this phone is what is best for me  but not everyone of course. we all have different tastes  preferences  and uses. for me  its the integration with my ipad  and imac  the integration with my friends and family who have ios devices  and it is the ability to plug in an instrument for practicing  sketching songwriting ideas  and recording riffs. also  im a semi avid gamer  and having access to the best library of games is significant to me. i also value simplicity  reliability  and smooth performance  over options suited for power users. in my humble opinion  ios is a better experience for me. with the past 2 android phones  i would get enticed by a new model  enjoy them for a 12 month honeymoon period  grow disillusioned by its shortcomings  then go back to an iphone. i need to stop doing that  as its not very cheap  lastly  i think everyone should try both  before deciding on what platform is best for them. with that said  the iphone 5 is a good place to start..

14,A3GMMI1FYLI6YF,2013-06-24,4.0,25.0,34.0,9.0,16GB,switched from android. i finally understand  hardcore techy  ios vs android vs windows phone 8.,hi there  this is a review from a 22 year old tech enthusiast. the review is quite long  but i have organized them into separate categories  so you dont have to read the whole thing. heres a little about myself.  i am a computer science major  and have always been an android fan. ive owned  nexus 4 galaxy nexus samsung galaxy s2 samsung note htc amaze htc sensation htc radar htc 8x many other older models  needless to say  i have had a lot of experience of all three mobile oses. i am very enthusiastic about tech  always swapping phones  always looking for that perfect phone. i own a macbook air and a custom built gaming desktop pc.  why i chose the iphone over the htc one and s4 i am under my stepdads family plan  so when it was time to upgrade  i had to choose between the htc one  s4  and iphone 5. i always thought i would choose the htc one when it first came out. however  i chose the iphone 5 mainly because i wanted something new to try. i know that the htc one and s4 are both great options  but they did not feel like a significant upgrade from a nexus 4 which i love. in fact  they seemed slower than the nexus 4 in everyday tasks most likely from fragmentation from htc/samsung overlays and carrier apps. the htc one has much better hardware than the nexus 4  but there is a definitely lag in the os due to the fragmentation. samsung s4 does a much better job with their software  but i hate their plastic feel. imho  i like the overall package that the nexus 4 gives you  which is high quality in both software and hardware. so because i felt my nexus 4 is better than both the one and s4  i decided to try out the iphone 5.  what i think of android i absolutely love the nexus 4 and the galaxy nexus  but i hate every other android phones. the fragmentation just makes the entire experience a chore. i spent so much time installing custom mods. most of the phones had major shortcomings no/late updates  battery life  intense lag  etc. to fix the software shortcomings  you would have to know how to mod  then research the best mods for you specific phone model  and update the mods when the cook for the mod release a new version. furthermore  the mods you install would oftentimes have bugs of its own. it just seems in order to enjoy nonnexus android phones  you have to be willing to spend the time on the phone. to me  thats bull****. i dont want to spend time on a phone  i have other stuff to do. a phone should make your life simpler  not the other way around. dont get me wrong  i absolutely love the nexus 4  the only shortcoming i see it having is it doesnt have lte and the glass back cracks easily. im not bashing on android  in fact there are a lot of things in android that i love which i cant do in ios torrents and file management to name a couple. android also syncs well with both pc and mac because of the file management system  and that most of its information is stored in the cloud. but the main idea here is that android is cluttered with too many information and overlay skins except for the nexus phones  major drawbacks whether it be software or hardware  and complicated. nexus phones on the other hand  ha great hardware and software. no overlay skins or carrier apps  just pure android. simple. if you like android  get a nexus device.  what i think of windows phone 8 two words. too young. the apps are noticeable worse than the android and ios counterparts. the youtube app was downright frustrating to use. i think microsoft is going in the right direction  giving the pc and phone a similar feel and integrating them together  but as of right now  they are still behind the curve. it syncs well with windows 8 pc  so it is simple to use  but the apps right now are simply trash. windows phone feels more like ios than android because they made it very simple to use and also limiting.  what i think of ios simplicity. sometimes a little too simple simple wifi toggles are impossible  will change in ios 7. to an advanced user like me  it also feels constricted. i cant just drag a movie file into the iphone  i have to convert the movie file into a file that itunes accept  then sync itunes with iphone. however  i do think itunes is a pro because it is kind of like the command center of your ios devices  where everything is located in one location  something i wish google will work on. ios is also very fluid. it is noticeable more fluid than the htc one and s4  but less so with the nexus 4. but mainly  the feeling you get with ios is simplicity. for example  lets look at the camera app. it doesnt give you as many options as the htc one camera app  but thats just how i like it. the options the iphone camera let you change are the options i actually understand  i have no idea most of what the htc one camera option even do. this can relate to almost everything on ios. it doesnt give you a lot of options  which equates to less clutter. the options they give you are options you understand and actually use. simple simple simple. ios also syncs very well with other apple products  and decently well with windows pc through itunes.  iphone 5 vs nexus 4 hardware only ill be comparing the iphone 5 to my favorite phone of all time yes even more than the htc one as explained above  nexus 4. the iphone have a better quality screen  better camera  better speakers  better built quality  slightly better battery life  lte support  better call quality 3 mikes  physical camera button volume up. the nexus 4 have better grips  smoother touchscreen slippery  bigger screen  faster processor and more ram though that doesnt matter in real life  smaller bezel. the screen is smaller on the iphone  which many see as a con  but i know that my girlfriend actually prefers a smaller screen because she likes smaller phones more pocketable...her words. i also enjoy having a change of pace with the smaller display  i can actually operate the phone with one hand  and its a lot less noticeable in my pocket. in general  the iphone 5 is better hardwarewise.  iphone 5 vs nexus 4 software only a lot of the shortcomings for android phones are not on the nexus 4. the nexus 4 is always updated with the latest software from google  and its super fluid. it doesnt have any htc/samsung/motorola overlays  or carrierforced apps. most importantly  pure android feels simple. something google needs to work on is something similar to itunes  a central program that keeps all the data of your phone and organizes them in a computer. i also absolutely love the software back  home  menu buttons. this is absolutely genius when the first introduced it on the galaxy nexus. this allows the phone to give you a wider screen realestate when you watch videos  and allowing the phone to have a smaller bezel. ios on the other hand feels even simpler  sometimes to a fault. like i said earlier  transferring movies onto the iphone seems like a chore  but it does stay in the itunes library for the future  so its not too bad. apples multitasking can be oftentimes more limiting than android  but it does save battery life. i am a very big supporter of apples hardware and software optimization. apple makes most of their hardware and all of their software  and they do it in a way that makes them work so well together. the iphone 5s power is probably half as powerful as the nexus 4 specwise  but it runs as fluid if not more fluid than the nexus 4. siri versus google now is also something to compare  but to me they are both great options much better than svoice at least. overall  android on the nexus 4 has a slight advantage over ios in my opinion  but ios is more simpler and organized.  this really depends on personal preference.  iphone 5 impressions after using the phone for about a week  i have not had any major issues or see any major drawbacks. the phone is simple and problem free. this is in no way of saying the iphone is perfect  its far from it. with my previous phones excluding nexus 4  ive always found major drawbacks that i simply cant live with  which explains why i switched phones so many times until i got the nexus 4  which ive stayed with for the longest. the iphone provides fantastic and beautiful hardware  optimized and simple software  and wraps them up together into a great experience. i also know that they will keep me updated with the latest softwares  unlike nonnexus android phones. the limitations on ios does give me some issues as an advanced user  but honestly  it doesnt bother me that much  simply because i dont do many advanced things on my phone anyways. the screen is a change of pace to me also  but i do enjoy using the phone in one hand  its a much better fit. to me  apple gives me the impression that it doesnt do anything perfectly  but it does do everything very very well.  conclusion do i recommend the iphone 5 well  how much money do you have if money is not an issue  go for it. if money is an issue  buy the nexus 4. both phones will give you a great experience. buy the htc one or s4 if you absolutely want a 1080p display and lte and hate the limitations of ios  but just know their software updates are usually months late  and sometimes will never come  and you will have a very cluttered experience. dont buy a windows 8 phone unless you have a very specific reason to do so.  i know of the android vs ios flame war that goes on even today  but it really boils down to personal preference. ive been on the android ship for a long time  because android allows me to do more stuff on my phone. but now that ive used so many different phones  i realize i dont use my phone to do anything advanced  i save that stuff for my computer. i realize i need a phone that doesnt need me to provide maintenance and troubleshoot. i need a phone that simplifies my life. i need a phone that does everything well. both the iphone 5 and nexus 4 does it. simplicity sells  and that is one thing that apple and google understands. samsung and htc has much to learn.    update after using the iphone for a little longer  i can say that there are some gripes i have against it  but also some positives.  cons most of my complaints stems from the lack of file management. for example i cant download a file from my email  only view it. i miss swype watching videos on a 4inch screen does seem constricting at first  but i got used to it. when using android  there usually is always a setting i can find that would solve whatever thats bothering me  whether its an android setting or app setting. on ios  many times i cant find those settings. android notifications seem better.  pros i thought my nexus 4 had a beautiful screen  but after using the iphone 5 and going back to the nexus 4 to try it out  i find the nexus 4s color washed out and inaccurate. the iphone 5 has a gorgeous screen. nexus 4 also seems super fat now lol. itunes keeps me organized  and also backs my iphones data up. nice to see coming from android. the size of the iphone really does feel great in one hand. most of the 4.7+ android phones feel constricting simply because you need both your hands free to do most tasks  especially on the galaxy notes. the reader feature on safari is fantastic the do not disturb feature is more useful than i thought. once again  the iphone reiterates to me that it doesnt do anything perfectly  but it does everything well.  additional thoughts google just added the htc one and s4 google edition phones on their play store. to summarize  both are running pure android  thus i think theyre better. however  because google wasnt the one who made the hardware for these phones  the pure android software isnt optimized on the phones yet. for example  most tasks seem faster on the skinned version of the phones. the ir blaster on the htc one also doesnt work as of right now. small things like this makes me hesitant to pay 600 for them right now. i rather wait for the next nexus device..
15,A2P6WKFYV8A3PC,2013-09-13,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,16GB,bought it for my niece..,i will never be dependent of na apple product or any other company which obliges me to do somethiing through a specific way. nokia sells more cellphones than the other four major brands combined. i particularly own na htc  but will switch to nokia soon.  however  teenagers are so into fashion and so ignorant regarding technology  all they want is to have what they think most people have  thus  the reason i bought the iphone for her  who now is starting to realize the few issues with apples os..
16,A36RKZS455BETF,2013-06-20,1.0,13.0,17.0,4.0,16GB,telephon lock.,i bought a unloched iphone but this item was lock  even due i ask that i need an unlocked phone   i especifficly that i need an unlock phone before the purchase. what can i do now.
17,A2U4TZ5PV6AGP1,2015-01-20,1.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,16GB,refurbished  not what i wanted..,it says its new  but it is refurbished. the charging port was not legitimate. the phone did not charge after a week. the earphones and the charging cable were also knockouts.  please  do not buy from these people. spend a little bit more and get it from the apple store. if you have any problems they will fix your phone or trade it for a new one..
18,A2XIOXRRYX0KZY,2014-07-25,5.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,16GB,or youre looking for a nice phone  this is a pretty great piece of ....,whether you prefer android  ios  or windows phone or even one of the less common options is a matter of personal taste. if youre an existing fan of ios  though  or youre looking for a nice phone  this is a pretty great piece of electronics.  i used it as my primary device for quite a while and it was always reliable. generally speaking  it had better reception than the other people around me. it seems that apple started putting a 2nd antenna in their devices after the issues with the iphone 4 antenna  and now it tends to have a reliably strong connection.  an iphone 5 runs ios 7 smoothly enough that i really never felt like i was missing out on anything by not having an iphone 5s. you can also be pretty confident that ios will continue to support the iphone 5 for a long time because the iphone 5c has the same hardware. since theyre still selling the 5c now  and apple continues support for a piece of hardware for at least a couple of years  these are well positioned for long term use even though theyre not exactly freshly released.  i actually personally preferred the slightly shorter screen that they had prior to the iphone 5  but i can understand why they felt they had to add more room. i was happy it stayed slim enough to be easily used onehanded.  its been a very lowfuss device that just does what i need it to do. the biggest advantage of iphone is probably that it has such incredible support from 3rd parties. the variety of accessories and apps  and the quality of them  is pretty amazing..
19,A7FAJVESJB3NU,2012-10-17,5.0,51.0,72.0,21.0,16GB,the best in my opinion.,pro the best phone  fancy design. light weight. bigger screen. everything is better than 4s.  con  pricy. you can get same one in ebay for 770.  if you are tmobile user > you should get a1428 model  not a1429 model.. tmobile will use att spectrum for lte in the usa. if you get this model a1429 for tmobile  u will be stuck with 3g only be aware.
20,A390JOY4LN3PBP,2012-11-11,2.0,90.0,129.0,39.0,16GB,disappointed.,i never wrote any review. this is my first time because i was so disappointed about my iphone 5. i am a huge fan of iphone and never go with anything else. i am using a macbook pro  and owned a macbook air. i was excited to wait for iphone 5. first  i love the new design. the weight is light  and the phone looks just so elegant compare to the 4 and 4s. i love the white color  and of course  the screen and its contrast is much better than the samsung galaxy note 2 my hubby using the note 2  switched from iphone 4s. so  2 stars because of the design. the disappointed part came from the signal. i got no wifi signal in my house  although i stand next to my router. my 4 and the note 2 got full bar of signal. but thats not the end of the story. last week i had some follow up with my dentist and my doctor. none of them could get a hold of me. they even asked me  when i called back  which is the good number to call me because theyd tried so many time but got my voice mail and if the voice mail is from the morning  it will never show up in my phone until afternoon or late evening. guess what  there was no signal/no service in my office which never happened to my iphone 4 nor the note 2  or any other phone everyone used in there. only 2 people did not have any signal at all  me and my boss who just got the iphone 5 as well. no wifi  no service  and no 4g. i felt like i was isolated in an island during 9 hours at work a day. not that  the signal got lost when i was on the road  too.  i went to apple store thinking of exchanging another phone  so i brought the 4 and note 2 with me just showing them i got issue with signal  not that i want something new in the box for resales or anything. they told me its a known issue and all the phone would be the same. we did a test. 5 apple staff carried 5 iphone 5 and me stepping out of the store. we all stood like 34 stores from the apple store. guess what none of their iphone 5 got any wifi signal nor the 4g works. my iphone 5 got 1 bar  but it went on and off  my 4 got 2 bars  and the samsung note got full bar so they proved to me nothing was wrong with my phone. i even got some sort of signal while they did not at all.  i am back to my iphone 4 now and returned the 5. att tried to sell me the galaxy s3  but because i always support apple  i did not want to use samsung. since i am back to iphone 4  i got service  signal  3g  wifi.. everything in my office  at the gym  at home  or anywhere i go..
21,A1N7CCFK6IM1PT,2014-09-06,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,16GB,brand new phone  unlocked but no apple warranty.,phone was delivered in 2 days as promised and the phone came in factory sealed box etc. so its brand new. however  i called apple to verify how much warranty i have remaining on this product and it turns out i dont have any warranty. this product comes with no warranty at all and since the product is already out of the peroid of 1 yr manufacture date  apple will not provide any warranty even if you wanted to buy one after buying the product.  i thought id write about it as i couldnt find the warranty information when i was considering to buy this phone on amazon.  phone works fine. it is unlocked so works right away with straighttalk.  more reviews in the next week as i get to know the battery condition of this phone. as thats one of the most important aspect w.r.t manufacturing date  warranty etc.  cheers  ashish.
22,A11LG6EV6P1IZ4,2013-07-27,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,16GB,best phone i have ever used..,this phone is my second new iphone  3rd if you count an old iphone 3g and it is the best iphone  and best smartphone i have ever used by far. the sweet aluminum build and the wonderful sensor placement as well as the size and the thinness and lightness just make this thing beautiful. i use it without a case alot. although  it is a little overpriced  499 or 399 is more like it i only had to pay 100 for it  with an early upgrade fee and getting 300 from an iphone 4 i sold on ebay. to sum it all up pros  fast  good looking  thin  light  simple to use  good features  wonderful resale value cons  expensive  soft aluminum  but you shouldnt be dropping it in the first place. this is a huge upgrade from an iphone 4 and iphone 4s in every way. the geekbench score is 6x higher than the 4 and 3x higher than the 4s and its very noticable. highly recommend.
23,A2V75I49C8COG5,2013-04-10,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,16GB,my first iphone.,ive been slow to upgrade but weve been loyal to other apple products and have really enjoyed using the ipod and ipad with the kids. as far as the phone went  i never saw the reason to get one  but now that i have i thoroughly enjoyed it.  the phone is faster than my laptop. my daughter has the iphone 4 and the screen on the 5 is bigger  and it has been really nice to use. its expensive enough i have invested in a case to protect it. i dont regret the purchase and love the new phone. i can load up the apps to keep the kids busy at the doctors office and not have to lug other toys or tech items along.  the phone was easy to learn to use and i had no problems with it after a month of use..
24,A27U0WGDT4NJNW,2012-11-26,4.0,22.0,31.0,9.0,16GB,solid phone  in most aspects..,after flipflopping between all major mobile electronics oss i have come to love ios. the design of the system is not perfect  but nonetheless it gets the job done quickly and without hassle. in a mobile communications device you expect two main things  one of which is consistency in operation. my iphone 5 does that well  if i need to make a phone call it gives me ways to do that quickly. even while im in a call the options to hold  remind  and merge calls is fantastic. simple tasks that i felt android and blackberry made too difficult. on the hardware side of things my iphone can handle most multimedia applications with no problem  and the retina screen makes them that much more enjoyable. some say that the os is restrictive  that is true but with restriction you gain consistency and the peace of mind knowing things that are meant for the iphone will just work. apple has come a long way from the original iphone that lacked even mms. with imessage  your messages are synced across idevices and make for sms between idevices flawless. except  when the service is down  which has happened several times over the past few months. even with this the iphone can switch to regular text messaging. the camera on the iphone is nice  still doesnt replace a dedicated camera  but for something that you put in your pocket  it does the job really well. my only gripe would be the materials used to manufacture the 5. the anodized aluminum is prone to scratching and necessitates a case. i got mine from amazon for only 9. and it only adds ~4mm of thickness and my iphone looks brand new after a little over 2 months of constant use. battery life is acceptable  putting my late epic 4g to shame by lasting a constant 1820 hours on a single charge with an average of 78hrs of constant use. overall i give this phone 4 out of 5 stars as the material it is made with is prone to scratching  but honestly that is my only gripe..
25,A3SWB22I8149FD,2013-02-25,4.0,8.0,11.0,3.0,16GB,iphone 5  ios 6.,i decided to skip the iphone 4s and made the leap to a refurbished iphone 5 from att. on february 5  2013  i received the iphone 5 and upgraded to ios 6.1  which went smoothly. after the iphone rebooted  the screen immediately started to transition to a white haze contrast every 510 minutes. i figured it was a faulty display  so i took the iphone to an apple store nearby and they exchanged it. i was handed a new iphone 5 and was very excited. after installing ios 6.1 on my new iphone everything went smoothly. i love the iphone 5 and all it has to offer  especially the ability to use airplay. having had the iphone 3g  4  i must say that using the iphone 5 with the latest firmware 6.1.2 is horrible. i had a better experience using the iphone 3g and 4. i am a certified it specialist and is having the following issues wifi connectivity is very poor  email loads very slowly  the app store downloads are still slow  apps take a long time to load  battery lasts about a day... to name a few. i know its not the iphone; but the software. i hope apple addresses these issues among others with their new ios release 6.1.3. i have the best iphone to date  just a not so good ios to complement it..
26,A3DILUUIWCRZL,2014-05-09,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,16GB,did not send item ordered.,i ordered a apple iphone 5 16gb white  unlocked  sold by nimlow electronics. instead they sent me a black phone. i am quite suspicious about it because 1.  they did not communicate that my phone was not available in white.  2.  they did not reduce the cost i was initially billed since the black sells for less..  3.  amazon had to be the ones to make contact with my dissatisfaction and i hope that this seller is removed from their listing. when people spend their hard earned money they ought to get what they paid for i will certainly not purchased anything from nimlow electronics in the future.

32,A1AAK694VTI9FT,2013-03-21,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,16GB,disappointed and frustrated with the iphone 5.,ive owned iphones since their first incarnation  and have until now almost always been pleased with the developments made to the next generation over the last  with the exception of the iphone 4 and the design fault that resulted in a complete drop of signal when held in your hand without a case on it i still own 2 of them  dont believe the spin  they really do drop signal.  the 4s is a great phone  quicker than the 4 and without the signal / aerial debacle.  the iphone 5 however is a disappointment.  its thinner apparently  not that youd notice  especially as due to its design you have to have it in a case to prevent it from being destroyed by everyday careful usage.  but in order to make it thinner they had so they say to change the sync lead / charger lead connector to a new smaller design. if like me you have owned and continue to own previous versions of iphones  ipods and ipads  and have several chargers  docks  car connectors and car chargers etc then this new design is really frustrating.  the real reason that apple changed the design is surely so that everybody has to go out and buy outrageously overpriced adaptors or new leads. i have read that apple pays less than 0.6 for these leads  yet charges its customers Â£25.  apple have also put a microchip in their leads that the iphone is set to recognise  without which they are rejected by the iphone in order to prevent third party manufacturers from producing leads that work properly  hence all the terrible reviews for these 3rd party products.  its just another of apples underhand money making exercises at the customers considerable inconvenience and expense.  its taller than the iphone 4s. some may like this  but i dont. the 4s sits comfortably in your hand and my thumb can reach the top of the screen on the 4s without having to change the position in my hand. i have bigger than average hands too.  it is faster than the 4s  only a little  but it is faster. but this is the only improvement in my eyes.  battery life is poor  another sacrifice made to the god of pointless thinness. it feels cheaper and flimsier than the 4s too.  maps are a mess. google maps was so much better on the 4 and 4s.  instead of this ridiculous connector fiasco  why couldnt we have kept the old and perfectly good connector and had wireless charging too the technology is there  and would be a great improvement over the current system.  a more robust design would be nice so that they didnt have to live in cases  and a dust and moisture resistant design would be very welcome.  icloud is fantastic  and so i cant imagine changing phones to another manufacturer until someone else comes out with something at least as good as icloud.  but when they do  ill be more than happy to switch allegiance  despite twenty years as a loyal apple customer.  apple can only push their customers so far  and im becoming more and more fed up with the way apple is treating its customers with regard to their infuriating thinness campaign with their phones  ipads  macbook pros and imacs  at the expense of functionality and in a blatant attempt to corner the market and limit customers buying choices in terms of leads  adaptors  connections  music purchasing  app purchasing etc  as are many many other people.  apple is a great brand and has produced many fantastic products  but the iphone 5 is not the leap ahead from the 4s that customers had hoped for  and this coupled with frustration and expense incurred by the connector design and the thinness over battery life and durability make it for me a 2 star product.  if you own the 4s id suggest hanging on to it and waiting until autumn for the next hopefully much improved iphone  or samsung  or whoever the apple slayer will be..

38,AK705SUS963DU,2014-09-29,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16GB,not impressed.,after having android phones ever since smart phones came out  this was my first iphone. i have to say it was better to begin with as i have had an ipod touch for awhile. after seeing friends get newer android phones  i have decided to switch back. i do not like the cursor on this  and the touch screen if very twitchy when it is plugged in. also the screen is quite small compared to some of the android phones out now which come with a price tag half that of apples. also i have had to replace the power cord twice in the past year that i have had it  at a cost of 20 a piece. in my opinion this is way overpriced for the quality..

55,A3DGADK060VXSK,2013-07-01,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16GB,great smartphone. terrible battery life  poor att support.,apple and att have very poor coordination on troubleshooting network issues with their productinpartnership. after 3 1hour support sessions by telephone over a oneweek period with no internet services  i was told by att that a visit to the apple store lucky for me i live near one would result in satisfaction by any means necessary. after spending an our in person there  and activating a replacement iphone  apple told me they could do nothing further that they have no ability to interface with att to solve my problem.  separately  i may have stepped up my taxation of batteries with more talk  text  data and wifi and bluetooth time  but i think im not the only one who finds this phones battery unacceptable. the existence of slick protective case+battery integrated products tells you you should buy this with the battery boost and compare applestoapples with a battery boost case. is it handy and pocketfriendly with the boost ive lived without a battery boosting case since purchase a 5 months ago  but im just about fed up with not getting through a day on this thing  and im certainly no yacketyyacker or webbrowsing poweruser or video junkie.  everything but the battery is great..

61,A1YYPEY0TJ7FLG,2013-04-28,5.0,11.0,16.0,5.0,16GB,my new best friend.,i dont know why i clung to my old phone if you could even call it that that only made calls and sent text messages for so long.  this incredibly light 112 grams smart phone  with its intuitive interface  has answered all of my prayers to the capitalist god  enabling me to take on the demons that every member of generation y must face in the doorway of 21st century. heres how  1. you know those moments when youre with other people  and theyre talking to each other  and youre expected to pay attention to the conversation and chime in with feigned interest  so much effort for so little reward.  you neednt fret any longer. with your face glued to this sleekly designed piece of commercial divinity  you can comfortably and constantly interact socially with internet identities in ways that are far less intellectually stimulating  all the while implying to the people around you that you have lots of other friends incessantly vying for your time.  the iphone 5 makes it simpler than ever before to avoid all the awkward social interactions that exist in the obsolete physical world.  2. remember the days when you needed to ask another person for directions to find your desired destination in a foreign place  you mightve even needed to ask a local if they had a recommendation for a good restaurant.  this inefficient  and potentially dangerous  networking is wiped away like crud on your windshield with the iphone 5.  you can just use the siri function instead.  gone are the days of uncertainty where you let the ambience of a town guide you to some unexpected  and mostlikely unsatisfactory  destination.  now  you can find whatever safe commercialized nirvana you like through a calculated google search  all without putting down your big mac and coke.  3. not even two decades ago  it was commonplace for people to rely principally on their memory to recall an experience of one great spectacle of our society or another.  this is not the case anymore.  your childs taking their first steps  well  youd better take out your iphone 5  and utilize the cutting edge hd video capture technology and 8mp camera.  you may never see that once in a lifetime experience with your own eyes  but at least your digital brain will have the memory stored forever.  if youre anything like me youll love these optimal features and more when you purchase the iphone 5 today..
62,A1EGEY418DYBBP,2012-12-31,2.0,15.0,22.0,7.0,16GB,new stuff has little good and plenty of bad..,let me start off by saying i purchased the iphone 5 and after fully using it  returned it after 14 days.  ive owned the 3g  4  4s  and the 5  before dumping it for another 4s.  to me  the 5 did not have enough of an advantage over the 4s  and indeed had some new negatives.  1. dozens of accumulated chargers suddenly worthless. 2. battery life no better than 4s  which could use more capacity already. 3. headset jack on the bottom is really senseless. 4. the phones lightness is good when in the pocket  but not good while holding. this is in part due to its awkard length to width ratio. 5. picture aspect ratio. again  the length to width ratio is just weird. i consider it either too long for its width or too narrow for its length. this affects not just the feel in the hand  but the aspect ratio of pictures taken.  after seeing a demonstration of svoice  i no longer think siri is the only game in town. so with this unexcpected lackluster model from apple  i think its a good time to switch brands.  on the plus side  the new charger is easier to connect to the phone because its reversible  and the headset is better than previous iphones. even users of older iphones should consider buying the new headset  it makes a difference..
63,A1C4AE93Y7TSX3,2014-08-01,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16GB,very good.,most likely the best phone in the world.design and functionality improved ios 7 has its drawbacks but apple will soon release 8 .you need a good case for this phone since most likely after first fall the screen will be shattered so be prepared.highly recommended..
64,A299AJVTD8NMV7,2014-07-31,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16GB,i love iphones  and this one is great.,i love iphones  and this one is great for the extra money  however  i feel an iphone 5 isnt a significant enough difference from an iphone 4s. however  the lte was something i used and appreciated. as far as iphones go in general  you cant beat them.
65,A15B8P22H1TWLM,2014-05-07,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,16GB,errr....,on july last year  i decided it is time to upgrade from my samsung galaxy note 1 to a new phone with up to date specifications. i decided to purchase the iphone 5 considering that it is an apple product and i would like to give it a try. however  i am sad to say that my expectations have been overestimated.   the iphone couldnt transfer contacts stored on my sim card to the phone considering that my two previous phones  the note 1 and the touch pro 2  could do it  i am puzzled as to why i am deprived of as a basic function. i ended up having to place my sim card back into my note 1  transfer the contacts onto my note  and use the bump application to transfer the contacts to my iphone. the fact that i have to rely on a third party application and my old android phone for such a basic task disappoints me.   poor file management and storage place utilization i am expecting itunes to be an optional tool for pc file transfer  much like samsung kies. and i was wrong. you must use itunes it might be trivial to some of you but i expect file transfer to be as easy as dragging and dropping the files into another window without the use of an extra programme  something that my old windows ce touch pro 2 could do. also  i realize that opening a music or video file in another app would result in the file being copied why is it that ios saw the need to have 2 copies of the same file to be played in 2 different apps is beyond me. that is a poor utilization of storage space.   lower quality video playback apps i love watching videos on my iphone when i am traveling to and from my workplace. it seems that the video playback apps on ios isnt as good as androids. i have diceplayer installed on my note and goodplayer and aceplayer installed on iphone. these apps are known to be one of the best on both android and ios respectively. file formats that i have problems playing on the iphone  i have no problem playing them on the note 1. although it is to be noted this is my observation on video playback apps  i wonder if this is the case of ios apps in general quantity over quality.  i could go on about the camera and other aspects.  to cut the review short  i ended up returning to my 2.5 years old galaxy note 1 after a couple of months. the fact that the new iphone 5 has problem topping my old note 1 greatly bothers me because i paid good money for it. i am left wondering why there are always so many people queuing and camping outside apple stores to buy the next new phone when the reality does not seem to exceed the hype. heres hoping that apple steps up their game this year..
66,A2KJ6W7YW1OG42,2014-08-14,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16GB,appreciation .....,first of all i said  sorry about my delayed to say thanks.i appreciate 1st likes a new iphone. 2nd  the battery life is amazing.3rd  can be able to use any carrier even any countries also; so  i can say thankyou.  ayu...
67,A26P2849EZKMJ2,2015-01-14,1.0,0,0,0,16GB,the phone went flat.,apple iphone 5 is terrible. the reception is horrible. here are my iphone stories. my mum had an iphone 5. we live in a country area called mundijong  and in our house  this phone picked up nothing. telstra has the best reception  and this little iphone 5 could not pick up signal in our house. my mum would have to go outside to get decent reception so she could go on facebook or ring her friends. after 2 years  the battery failed. now this phone goes flat after one day  even when she wasnt doing a single thing on it this phone started getting hot  so she purchased iphone 6 and the reception is wonderful. straight away in our house  facebook has been brought up and she is poasting away. my dad has a basic sampsung flip phone and the reception on that was better than the iphone 5. uncle clayton also has iphone 5 and the charger is terrible. the cordes keep breaking. whenever you use a corde that is not an apple  the phone stops charging and lets you know you are not using an official apple charger. there are cordes designed by other manufacturers that can fit this phone  and this phone detects them. i always get in trouble with clayton because he keeps accusing me of fiddling with the corde whenever it wasnt charging. the battery life is terrible. flat within one day and the reception is terrible. i was going up the hill  ringing my friend to order me a cd and after ai finally got through to him  the thing dropped out and i never got my cd ordered. so i went home and ordered it myself. long story short  iphone 5 has the worst reception and the worst battery life in the world..
68,A1OK0GL39YHFN2,2015-02-22,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,a simple  useful  and enjoyable experience..,receiving the iphone 5 was an exciting experience and a huge upgrade from my previous phone. i needed a phone that would help me keep up with my busy life and that would be enjoyable to use. i have had the iphone 5 for two years now and have found that even though i constantly use it every day  it still functions correctly and has been a great experience. as others have written in their reviews  the iphone 5 is beautiful and well crafted. when it was first released it was noted that compared to other phones the design of the device was more sleek. the claims that apple had made about the battery life upgrade from their previous phones were honest and allow for hours of operation. the downsides of the iphone 5 are that all previous cords for the devices need adapters for the new port or have to be replaced with the newer product. because the case is made out of aluminum  which is a softer metal  it is susceptible to scratches without a protective case. overall this phone has made my connections with people in life simpler. completing my daily tasks  maintaining a social life  capturing special moments on camera  not being tied down to a specific place such as a library or a computer to check my emails  all these things have been a part of the experience ive had while possessing this phone. owning the iphone 5 has improved my daytoday functions and brought me closer to my friends  family  and acquaintances..

75,A1EBYXYLMSN652,2015-02-06,2.0,0,0,0,16GB,battery was dead/failing.,so you know its an iphone so its going to be really awesome.they shipped it just fine and it got here to los angeles okay  but upon receiving the phone the battery was dying. at an amazing rate it could hardly hold a full charge for 30 minutes. so i ended up taking it to the apple store and i found out that theres certain iphone 5s that were sold with poor batteries and apple will  replace them for free if your phone qualifies. i entered in my serial number and it did qualify.  it was kind of a bummer that i had to go to the apple store and spend four hours of my day getting a battery for my new/used phone  but on the bright side i got a brandnew battery they did a diagnostic to see if theres anything else wrong with it and there wasnt anything and they change the used phone to be in my name because it was in the previous owners name. so like if this seller a threestar for not checking their phones very well but regardless im still really happy with my new iphone.

80,A2VOS1M3NIGO5P,2012-10-21,5.0,12.0,18.0,6.0,16GB,another great iphone from apple.,i have had the iphone 5 since the 2nd week of the launch  thanks to the early delivery of apple  right lets get to the point and straight i am writing a lot more in comparison rather than reintroduce you to iphone again  so most of my points are in comparison to the previous  the 4s.  better speakers and microphones it has 3 mics now which are in front  back and bottom. the voice memo turns out to be a lot clearer  and sounds delivering to your caller is much improved as well. it does help on the facetime sessions. more mics also mean that elimination of more noise and much noisecancellation too.  faster  period the iphone 5 is definitely faster than the 4s. units are put in comparison and it does slide smoother and faster. i used to turn on so many apps and always forgot to close them until my phone become so slow. i havent quite had the need to close the apps like i used to.  new lightning connector is cool  and easy to plug i have had bad luck with the old dock connector. at one point i ruined the connector of the old 3gs due to force connection to it. 2 of the pins broken so i have to sent to apple for warranty. with the new lightning  you can connector front or back or it does not matter. it fits on either side so it is a great improvement however be prepared to pay more as they are no generic available yet  so make sure you keep yours with care for now  better front facing camera the front camera is now 720p  which deliver clearer video to your facetime caller  or improving your photo quality for those of you who like to take selfportrait. the back camera is the same as 4s though  which is a 8mp with flash. the latest ios6 enables panoramic phototaking  which is my favorite.

83,A1W218WAQVQEZY,2014-12-30,3.0,0,0,0,16GB,as i said before not that bad but very irritating at times.,the phone itself works but there are some technical flaws  for one the phone does not sound everytime i get a text  it will notify me but sometimes i will not hear the sound or vibration from the phone  this notification problem happens on whatsapp and line as well.  another problem that it has is that sometimes people will call me and i have their name already saved on my phone but the phone number will just show up without the name so i do not know who is calling me....as i said before not that bad but very irritating at times.  hope this review helps.

86,A3O89E6CAA4BSL,2013-02-04,5.0,7.0,11.0,4.0,16GB,review of iphone 5.,iphone 5 is the best smartphone on the market. the apple brand not only brings a professional quality to your life but also provides numerous outlets for support while allowing you to protect your information with free software updates and virus protection. the iphone 5 has become one of the most well known phones and has made an impact  not only on the smartphone market  but also on everyday consumers that have purchased one. once you have tried using the iphone 5 it is easy to see why it has an edge on all of the other competitors. the numerous reasons why the iphone 5 is so popular and common is because of the user friendly software and unique features that are preinstalled and the availability of almost anything your mind can imagine.   the icloud is a great feature included with the iphone 5. the icloud feature is part of the ios software system that comes with your iphone 5. you are able to also download icloud on other apple devices you own and can save and access any data uploaded to the cloud from any of your devices. with icloud your files are saved on apples servers which are similar to using an online email  only you can save so much more than text documents. if you are using icloud with your apple devices then your information is automatically saved when you are in range of wifi services. the reason this is important is because if you accidentally delete a file you need you can go into icloud and retrieve the file. this makes sure you dont have to worry about losing the information on your phone. with icloud you can now save time and space on your devices without having to worry about tedious file transfers between your phone and your computer. another option with icloud is being able to have your music with you whenever you need it  no matter what apple device you are currently on. when deciding if the iphone 5 is the smartphone for you icloud is just one of the features that makes that decision easier.  another fantastic option the iphone 5 offers is its panorama feature in the camera setting. panorama is defined in many phrases such as  unbroken view  whole region  and wide view. it now allows the user to take multiple pictures and the iphone will put it all together into one larger scaled photo. for example if you are taking a picture of a bridge and you want to capture the entire architecture  you can. when you open the camera application on the phone  select options and tap on panorama  once the setting has been applied you can take the entire picture. the option allows for you to scroll the phone left to right and as you do so the iphone is taking multiple pictures and combining them into one large image.   facetime is an amazing feature that is preinstalled on your iphone 5  no need to set up a special account or screen name  which saves you time right from the beginning. the facetime feature allows you to make video calls with anyone you choose and the iphones front facing camera allows for your friends and family to see you while you chat with them. apples software makes using the facetime feature flow seamlessly with calls by allowing you to just tap a button while in a phone call and switching to facetime. this feature can even be utilized in the corporate environment with conference calls  saving your company time and money. and now facetime can be used anywhere  with apple updating the app so that you can stream your video calls over your cellular service and are not limited to just using wifi. features like facetime can help add the finishing touch to your decision on purchasing an iphone.    in todays market there are so many choices with smartphones that it can be difficult to make a decision. when doing research on the top selling phones on the market the iphone 5 stands out with more apps  features and overall performance. other phones like the iphones leading competitor  the samsung galaxy s3 have some features that are not included with the iphone 5. for starters  the galaxy s3 has different software and therefore doesnt make you conform to apples unique methods of use. also  some features  like the popular sbeam  allows you to transfer files with the tap of your galaxy s3 phone to another galaxy s3 phone  which brings file sharing to a whole new level. while you can get this feature on your iphone 5 with an app created to do this  some people like the convenience of having it preset and not having to worry about downloading an app.  another feature that can be troublesome with the iphone 5 is that the battery cannot be easily changed out for a new one when it does not hold a charge as well as it once did and changing the battery voids your warranty. phones like the galaxy s3 do allow for the capability to change out their batteries so you can have consistent battery power when you need it.  the pros of the iphone 5 seem to outweigh the cons of the galaxy s3 but it all depends on what you want in a phone..
87,A39HG1ZYNJJEDY,2014-08-01,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,16GB,i am very satisfied with that.,i got the iphone 5 from amazon  i am very satisfied with that..
88,A1NJQ5CY6IMB75,2015-01-13,1.0,0,0,0,16GB,iphone 5 didnt even switch on for one time very disappointed..,i ordered from ross cellular and  got this phone very exited and opened  first of all i didnt switch on thought battery might have fully drained and waited for an hour to charge nothing worked and again waited for more hours i didnt turn on very disappointed. i have bought lot of apple products never faced this  dont know where the problem they might have sent the defective product to me.i am going t return it today13 jan 2015.
89,A3Q8PIRN22OHSN,2014-07-09,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,16GB,dont buy off of wranglerrusso this kid.,well i just ordered this and sure enough it wasnt a new iphone. was a year old when i checked the imei number and called apple. warranty is up in 43 days lol. the seller is some kid wranglerrusso jason russo through kentucky. working on a resolve now but clearly this is froud if any seller is doing this. dont buy off of wranglerrusso this kid.
90,A1LKWMYLSLEYDQ,2013-12-26,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,16GB,still the best  there is.,ive owned an iphone 3g scratches easily  iphone 4 a game changer  and an iphone 5. before anyone thinks im an apple fanboy  im not. i found ios to be restrictive and difficult to customize without jailbreaking it  so i sold my iphone 4 and bought one of the best android phones at the time  a samsung galaxy s2 which started having hardware/software problems about a year later. the iphone 5 has features that ultimately trump all other phones out there on the market  and its pros far outweigh its cons.  the iphone 5 is by far the most reliable phone ive ever owned. the hardware is second to none. the glass on the front is strong enough that ive never used a screen protector on it. ive thrown it in a bag with other electronics and i never had to worry about the face of the phone getting scratched  as long as you dont put it in your pocket with sharp objects like a bunch of keys and  play rugby. however  youll need a cover for the back of the phone because it may still get scratched when you place it on a table and push it across the surface. youll also need to take care of the camera lens because that may get scratched unlike the glass on the front.  ive dropped all of my iphones every now and then  but they all continued to work well afterwards. with the iphone 5  i dropped it several times from waist level onto hard tiles and the worst result was a barely noticeable dent in the aluminum on the side of the phone  but otherwise this thing is build like a brick. ive never had a problems with the battery or anything rattling on the inside of the phone after damaging it  ios never skipped a beat. the hardware rather than the software is what brings me back to apple. i cant say that about the cheap  plastic and brittle hardware of android phones in my experience  the plastic chips easily  the camera is very sensitive to shocks  and the software will go crazy like rebooting on its own at random times. you wont need to buy replacement parts that are outrageously expensive i.e. a genuine samsung battery cover made of thin plastic will blow your mind. the screen resolution continues to be clear  crisp  bright  and hands down better than any android phone.  consumers may be purchasing bigger phones including near ipad size phablets  but i commend apple to sticking to its guns on keeping the size phone relatively the same. with bigger phones like the samsung note 2  youll have to use both hands to make selections on the screen  especially if you need to tap something on the far edge of the screen. with the iphone 5  you dont need humongous hands or slender man fingers to navigate the screen. it fits perfectly in your palm and fits in any pocket easily compared to the bigger phones out there.  i have to say that ios copied some of its improvements from android to make it better and there is still room to improve. you cant customize settings shortcuts and trying to turn a feature on or off feels like you have to navigate through a maze of menu choices until you finally get to where you want to be. you can place a bunch of apps in a folder but only the first 9 apps are visible unless you open the folder and swipe around. apple continues to have the best apps available through the app store.  another downside is the fact that you have to buy authorized 3rd party charging docks/cables in order to charge the phone. ive had some cheap but reliable charging cords that i bought online  but those failed to work when news broke of a consumers phone exploding or was it burning after overcharging it with an unlicensed 3rd party accessory. authorized aftermarket accessories tend to be less competitively priced and are priced toward the more expensive end.  all in all  the iphone 5 continues to be one  if not the best  of all the smartphones out there today..
91,A3RM1EIJ8G2DV8,2013-09-07,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,16GB,excellent product. great seller.,im really happy with the product. i wish its battery lasts a little bit longer. the seller answered my questions really fast and politely. the phone is unlocked  as soon as it arrived i inserted the chip and i did not have any problem. it is new  and came with the headphones and charger as stated. it is a serious and very reliable seller. i defenitely recomend it and would buy again anytime.

94,A1D63A1P3SVYTU,2013-06-27,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,16GB,superior qualtiy.,ive owned this phone a few months now and love it. the quality craftsmanship is one of the things that sets this phone ahead of the pack. instead of a cheap plastic case most cell phone have  this is metal and hardened glass.  the crazy thing about this phone is that while the screen got bigger from the last iphone  it also got thinner and lighter. people who happen to pick up my phone cant believe how light it is.  as far as the software goes  its topnotch. its so intuitive to use that even mom techphobic mom can use it  and actually have fun in the process. unlike other phones like android  you dont have to worry about viruses and malware.  wonderful phone..
95,A3LLP5WEO4T5MS,2013-06-18,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,16GB,needs improvement.,i like most of the features of this phone. however  i hate technology that does not work well and apple advertises it like if it was perfect. siri  for example  has problems understanding many words. so it is sometimes frustrating when dealing with it. dictation is out of the question since you will spend more time fixing the sentences from the wrong words and phrases which siri made. the phone to the ear feature is also frustrating  since it does not work every time. so it is best to forget that this feature even exists. i do not understand why would apple make a feature that would not work every time. it just makes the feature a pain to use. and the idea behind technology is to make things easy and even provide you with a bit of fun  not to make you want to smash it against the sidewalk..
96,A3BNBW19U2DM9H,2013-03-14,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,16GB,wasnt impressed.,when the iphone 5 came out for preorder i thought it was a must considering i am a huge fan of apple.prior to my iphone 5 i owned an iphone 4s like i said a huge fan of apple. throught my year of owning this i experienced no problems. yet with an iphone 5 within the first month i faced multiple problems  my lock button refused to work so i went to apple returned it and they gave me a new one free of cost because my insurance covered it.this was now my second iphone 5  with this one i lost service constanstly  my phone would reset itself and it wasnt as fast as my 4s was also wasnt as fast as it was presented to be. the lock button refused to work even at this point. i am now on my 3rd iphone 5 and have not yet faced any problems. if you were considering purchasing this i recommend a little more reseasrch and maybe just waiting on the new iphone to come out..

110,A3K6KUMZPKICCW,2014-06-28,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,not just a review on the iphone.,i wanted to take the time to write a review not on the iphone  which anyone can find a review on  but on the seller. the seller is by far the friendliest and accommodating seller i have ever purchased online from. the iphone had some sort of glitch at the beginning which was solved by plugging into laptop  and the seller stood by his product for a whole month just to make sure i was happy. before this purchase  i was deathly afraid of buying phones online because i have heard of empty packages or nothing received. well  with this seller  you will have the benefit of knowing you will be taken care of directly and promptly  regardless of what you think about the iphone product..
111,A2DP6DQ32KALAE,2014-06-27,1.0,0,0,0,16GB,simply unacceptable. you order a new phone  you ....,simply unacceptable . you order a new phone  you receive a used one. missing charger. i guess it is worth going on a store  pay and get what you pay for..
112,A4P7XLGW92HGC,2014-06-25,1.0,0,0,0,16GB,no original defective equipment.,this phone is not original  not iphone serial no phone in your casing. the microphone does not work  one week only served when received from time not worked therefore need the return my money.

115,A1A5ENLV9M7798,2014-06-22,3.0,0,0,0,16GB,defective product.,my iphone 5 leaked battery after 1.5 years of use. in addition to leading to pathetic battery life  this caused the screen of the phone to come apart slightly. i see this as a safety issue and am surprised that this phone hasnt been recalled. while i was in store  i saw atleast 5 other people complain about the poor battery life problem.  initially apple genius drew a line in the sand and asked me for 269 to replace the phone with another iphone 5. i agreed. a little later  turned out that they replaced it for free. i appreciate that they ended up replacing the phone but instead of arguing about how the phone was warranted for 1 year  i would have expected the apple genius to see reason on seeing a phone leaking acid without any physical damage at the beginning..
116,A2M6M3F5K4620S,2014-06-21,3.0,0,0,0,16GB,good but missing sim opener device.,product is brand new and good but i havent received small device through which sim card is opened. expected all part.
117,AZ3GREEC2FVFN,2014-06-15,1.0,0,0,0,16GB,faulty charger.,the charger which accompanied this phone is faulty and its either it is not the rightful charger for this product or it just isnt working.  this charger neverrrrrrr worked a day since i receive the phone and i had to use my ipad charger. and now that i misplaced my ipad charger i have nothing to use and will have to expense myself and buy a charger for a phone that had all rights to have came with a working charger. this is not satisfactory at all.

126,A31RZMVAFMLB8B,2014-04-24,4.0,0,0,0,16GB,i could not get t mobile to activate this.,so this review is really about purchasing an unlocked phone  which i found does not always work if the carrier in this case t mobile. i found  they will want you to purchase only there phones and in so tell you that your unlocked phone doesnt work with there system..

131,A2P61YP5G43XA3,2014-04-04,2.0,0,0,0,16GB,not satisfied.,touchscreen it is not working very well. and accesories are generic and dont work. and it wasnt cheap at all.
132,A118G26NEGH8IG,2014-03-20,4.0,0,0,0,16GB,hmm what do you say about an iphone.,if youve reached this page you probably already have one. probably not more than five feet away from you right now. they are addicting sooo many times ive said  hey let me not be one of the masses and switch to a droid  and always  i come back.  the one reason why im leaving one less star for this product  is because there have been some noted charging issues with the 5. i had it happen to mine the charging port just stops working one day  and no  i didnt drop my phone or anything  its basically my baby so  i googled this issue and it seems to be specific to 5s.  also  if youve reached this you may have lost your phone and not had insurance. i always get insurance even tho ive only lost my phone once. its a lot easier to pay 200 than to come buy an unlocked one  but its also smarter to buy an unlocked one if you are considering signing a contract phone contracts suck  especially with all the competitive deals they have going on  u should be free to choose where u go  whenever u want  anyways  last thing i wanted to say  is this phone doesnt differ that much from the new 5c and 5s. so they have a couple cool features like the thumbprint unlock i just dont think its worth it unless your obsessed with little upgrades like that/technology. i swear the biggest jump was from the 4s to the 5 in terms of what the phone looks like  in recent times anyways. if you are considering this or one of the newer ones  id go with this until the 6 comes out or 6s lol. to save you some money. unless you just need to unlock your phone with your thumb ;.
133,A3NQ36R8CX7IQB,2014-03-16,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,must have.,no problems at all its legit. dont think too much about it just get it and you wont regret it..
134,A3QUKOKRUSBJI4,2014-03-12,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,a helpful review.,i love my iphone 5 for making mini movies of my kids like this oneâ¦.  [...]  but there are sooooo many choices here are some helpful hints.  [...].
135,AMVBAT38WB4BU,2014-03-09,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,iphone 5 review.,the iphone 5 looks almost identical to the iphone 4s  so its not so easy to tell them apart  especially from a distance since their shapes are so similar. like its ancestor  the new model has rounded corners and a metal band along the edges. from then on  thats where the similarities stop. the iphone 5 weighs only 3.9oz while the iphone 4s weighs 4.9oz; apple has finally moved up from its usual 3.5inch display and moved onto a 4inch on the iphone 5. apple has not only made the iphone 5 look slimmer but faster software wise. apple went above and beyond with the ios6 software  such as having the ability to reply to a text message when you dont want to take a call  or have a do not disturb mode where you can set a time when only certain people can contact you. they say you can keep the best for last but since the iphone has such great features one of the best is siri. itâs now more developed  siri has learned a bit more in 2013  as this voicerecognition system with spoken responses can now get sports statistics and let you know when the next time the lakers are playing. she can even compare stats between kobe bryant and michael jordon. for other practical uses  you can now post on facebook through siri  and also responds noticeably faster with more accuracy in speech recognition and data searching..
136,A2DSHZICFYS56K,2014-03-09,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,still the market leader.,iphone in my opinion will always remain to be the market leader in smartphone.the apple software is unbeatable.the super camera the galore of incredible apparently and the super quality using makes it the best smartphone by miles.
137,A1Q7SSJWEC644L,2014-03-06,3.0,0,0,0,16GB,problems with the screen display.,a few time i bought this iphone 5  the screen display failed i had to buy another screen but smart phone does not work good.
138,A8S729JMUD0SJ,2014-02-26,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,i love my new iphone 5.,the best phone ever. its fast  beautiful and useful. i like everything about this phone. you literally cant find better one today. iphone 5s is just wasting money for a finger print thing..
139,AAPXNYCZH6KLT,2014-02-24,4.0,0,0,0,16GB,cool.,changing from an android to apple is different but i like it . the phone is good just wish it wouldve come with earpods and charger..
140,A3K75E98B5RVUG,2014-02-24,1.0,0,0,0,16GB,poor battery performance.,i am having the same problem with the phone again. previously i ordered the 5 and the battery would not hold the charge. i sent it back and got the 5s and the same problem is recurring. should i take it to am apple store.
141,A3U07R0A3D4T1E,2014-02-15,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,good customer service.,good customer service it helps a lot  i did not buy the phone eventually  but next time if i need any electronics i would definitely go to this store.
142,A2VUOG2MBB2NGS,2014-02-11,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,love my ipbone.,i recieved my iphone on time. they had a surprise for me i got a 46g instead of 16g memory. then  before putting my simcard in  i checked the serial number with apple company and they told me its not an unlocked phone and i was pissed off and called these seller and told them i want to return the phone they were nice people and asked me to put my simcard and start using it and they were sure that it is unlocked later  i found out that they were right and when you put your simcart in  it automatically gets unlock so  i am satisfied with my purchase  and recommend this seller.
143,A3FSI98GG0KGU,2014-02-08,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,upgraded to 32gb for free.,i was quite surprised when i got the phone and realized i got a 32gb instead of the 16gb  loved the upgrade  phone works great.
144,A1KQR5TN0SLSSG,2014-02-06,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,waited too long but phone works great.,it took forever to get to me  dont know if it was the seller or the post offices fault  but i needed an unlocked phone to travel to greece and it worked great i got just what they said  a used iphone. i had no issues with it and im happy with my purchase.
145,A2ULELLOMOKPAC,2014-01-28,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,excellent.,best phone around..  if you dont want to waste 100 extra  for the same phone  iphone 5s ; iphone 5c  just buy this one  same quality and performance.. therefore you can use the money that you save  on buying higher memory size...
146,A2KMATDHPFBMFG,2013-11-10,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,what i expect from apple.,im a die hard iphone fan and i will probably be for a long time. this phone impressed me not only is it faster and sleeker with its new upgraded processor and frame  but it also has a taller screen. it feels like this taller screen adds to comfort and give the buttons on screen ease of access. aside from the s and c models to buffer the real releases apple hasnt let me down and i cant wait for the 6.
147,A3RU6HE8KB7PSE,2013-11-02,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,the price is high but you are getting a great phone.,we all know that apple has high prices so why complain about it in a review i bought the phone knowing that it was not going to be a cheap phone. im glad i spent the money on it.  after having two junk phones within the last few years i finally bought an iphone  it does everything it says and is great.  calling works great on here ive never had an issue with calls besides signal issues with my carrier.  the phone has never froze on me. that was a huge issue with me having having my last phone always freeze even after deleting all the apps on it. i have never had a issue with this phone not wanting to work properly.  everything apple says it does it really does. i dont have an issue with syncing the phone to my computer or charging it. the home button works great as well as the top button.  i dont think i could go back to any other phone this will always be my phone of choice no matter the price of the phone..
148,A1Z5YZ7S30GUOY,2013-11-02,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,excellent product every time.,apple products i have never failed me.  always delivers perfectly sized and sleek design.  perfect camera shot every time and many more apps than its competitors. a user friendly product. the only product that it can use to view my favorites such as 48 hours mystery episodes among others and can also use majic jack.  i used the ipad gen 2 before but i find the mini to be less bulky and easier to carry around..
149,A3BIQRE0ZX59CE,2013-10-27,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,good.,meet my expectation   good   thanks in order to protect its screen   i buy a iphone case. if you match a case with this ipone  i think it will be more convenient to the customers  as would save the time to select and buy the case..
150,A2GYC59CGTALB5,2013-10-25,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,good stuff.,my only complaint is that the charger is not apple  its a duplicate and seems to have bad connectivity. other than that  the phone is perfect  practically brand new  just as advertised..

158,AR6MCR8J363V5,2013-10-02,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,satisfied client.,it works perfectly  and came with all accessories in its box. i love the colour  the size and specially the new earpods..
159,A3U9FHD6CUU987,2013-10-02,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,best cell phone i have ever used.,best cell phone i have ever used  this iphone is amazing the color gives it a sharp clean look.the screen resolution is pretty awesome its very easy to use and navigate. there are over 900 000 games and apps in the app store you can pay for for  lots are also free. ios 7 makes the iphone 5 even easier to use. ios 7s new taskbar lets you turn off your wifi or bluetooth  control you portrait rotation and turn on the iphones flashlight. i also redesigns all of the apps on your iphone.  if you are going to buy the iphone and plan on downloading lots of stuff movies  music  games  etc then you might want consider buying an iphone with more space. the iphone 5 hard drives come in 16 gb  32 gb and 64 gb.  the recently released iphone 5s only has few upgrades from the the iphone 5  including a little bit faster phone. even though the iphone 5 is extremely fast already. it also has a fingerprint scanner which is pretty cool  but not worth the price.  pros  cons lightweight  take a long time to turn on easy to use  16 gb is too small can upgrade very nice clean look good battery life fast charging good sound quality great picture quality overall this is a great phone.
160,A2DAS3GE9AQIC,2013-10-01,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,iphone 5.,when i first saw the iphone 5 it seemed stupid because i thought it was the exact same thing as the 4. i later realized that the 5 is way better some people say that it is not worth the money  but in my opinion i think it is. it is nothing like the 4 it is super light and really skinny the 5 is bigger but thats one thing i like about it i really like all of the cute cases and accessories and everything you can buy to go with it. the iphone 5 works really well and its also fast. i really like the 5 and if you are looking for a good and fast phone i suggest you get it  when i used the iphone 5  i became addicted to it. some people ask me whats the difference between an iphone 4 and a iphone 5 well  its longer and thinner  which makes the screen longer. theres also the lightning charger  which makes the charger fit into the plugin on the phone both ways. on the iphone 5 the back isnt glass like the iphone 4  its titanium which prevents the back from breaking.i recomend the iphone 5 to anyone who drops their phone often. i dropped my iphone 5 in the toilet once  everything still works fine. the sound was a bit gurgly but a little rice fixed that..
161,A3MXHZD3BSB1LQ,2013-09-30,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,great product and worth the price.,i purchased this product because it was time for me to purchase my first phone. i am glad i chose to purchase the white iphone 5. it has fast internet connection  long lasting battery life  tons of cool features and apps  plus its also lightweight for easier use.  when i first turned on my iphone  i immediately figured out how to use it. my iphone was very easy to navigate and download new apps. i would recommend this phone for anyone eleven years or older.  the only problem i ever had with my phone  was with the computer itunes program. it was slow  and hard to figure out how to sync my new purchases onto my iphone. however  my iphone 5 was much better than my sisters iphone 4s model. it has faster internet connection  and sends texts faster. plus it has a bigger screen  with longer lasting battery life. overall  i think the iphone 5 is a great product and worth the price for all the features it has. i am glad i chose to purchase the iphone..
162,A10EKC6DZ32CJ9,2013-09-26,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,i love it..,i think the iphone 5 is same as description  so i give 5 star to it  thank you very much.

165,A3747AUDPAY4DV,2013-09-14,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,great phone.,wonderful. i managed to get a used model  which was actually like new but discounted. it is an apple product so all the pluses are there so many apps  so many functions. however as always with apple products you have the down side their own sized sim card cannot open product for battery replacement etc..
166,A24O6ZCGHCJWSK,2013-09-10,5.0,0,0,0,16GB,great deal..,in different countries i just needed to purchase a prepaid sim  and thats it the delivery was accurate. there was no issues with delivery or product quality..
167,A1BTMG826DZ6W,2013-09-10,3.0,0,0,0,16GB,not completely satisfied.,it was fine both the charger didnt work at all...good thing ive ordered the package with the car one so i use that instead of the one that was supossed to. it also had some scratch that i didnt notice at first but they were there....and i didnt even use it when i got it...at least works.....

252,A2RPP08HG90U74,2014-10-07,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,16GB,the iphone scam.,dont buy the iphone unless you want to be scammed. i brought two new iphones  one for myself and one for my wife over the past two years. two and a half years ago i brought a new 4s for myself and last year i brought a new iphone 5 for my wife. about one month ago the wifi stopped working on my phone. i took it to the apple store in brandon florida. the genius at the genius bar looked at it for five minutes and then told me the wifi card was not working and that i would need a new iphone. three days ago my wifes phone stopped connecting to the wifi. we took it to the apple store in brandon and another genius looked at and made the same announcement after three minutes. again we were told that we needed to buy a replacement phone. i smell a scam. we paid 700 each for these phones when they were new. now two and a half years later for me and one year later for my wife a major component does not work. scam. rip off. do yourself a favor and avoid the iphone  unless you want to just keep handing over your money to apple..

321,ASB1KEISYIW12,2013-09-12,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,16GB,iphone 5.,well  i do own an iphone 5 and the product is great  however i tried to purchase this and the seller apparently went out of business  never refunded the money or let me know what was going on with my order.  amazon was awesome  i submitted a claim and got a full refund with no problems and very little effort in less than 2 days  so for a product review i do love this phone  i am partial to android but for my less tech savvy spouse this thing is great  phone calls  entertainment and the best way to keep from nagging at each other on long drives makes it a great addition to the family. keeps her busy enough so she isnt verbally assisting my driving as much as normal.  also the blue tooth works perfect for streaming music to the stereo and hands free calling.  as much as i am not an apple fan form many reasons  this is a superb product if you dont need expandable storage or multiple tethering type options..

332,A3LAR2U0VK5YVI,2013-01-15,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,16GB,high quality iphone.,the iphones quality has once again been proven as many flock to apple stores to purchase the new device. i personally feel that while the iphone has not added any drastic new features  it has almost perfected the ones that are familiar to past apple customers. the device is very sleek and wellbuilt. after two months of regular use  it still appears to be new. the screen is fingerprint resistant unlike many of the past iphones. the camera is excellent not to say that past iphones havent been able to take good images. it can take panoramasa very well done effort by apple to take existing ideas from third party applications and perfect them. the main disadvantage of the iphone 5 is the lack of good maps support. however  given that apple is the most valuable company in the world  i am confident that it will spend a portion of its wealth to perfect imaps in coming ios updates..

396,A2RD3RYAON46C2,2012-12-27,3.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,16GB,terrible battery life  wait 6 months to buy the iphone 5 until they work out the bugs.,im reviewing the iphone 5  not the 1000 iphone 5 sold here.  i bought it via att for the upgrade price of 199.  so price is not the issue here.  love the phone.  hate the battery life.  im on my 2nd phone and something clearly is wrong.  there are loads of people complaining about the battery life on the apple support forums.  it is not clear yet whether it is a hardware or ios problem  but i can say for sure that this phone does not get half the battery life my iphone 4 had.  ...and i have babyed it by completely draining the battery and recharging  turning off wifi when not in use  turning off lte  bluetooth when not in use  turning off icloud passport  turning off email push notifications  none of which i had to do on the 4 except the 4 didnt have passport or lte.  but still  you get the idea.  apple claims the longer battery life is one of the bonuses of this phone.  nothing could be further than the truth for me and many users.  i personally have spoken to 4 people who have the issue.  another handful report not having the issue which is good.  but 5050 rate of success is too poor a ratio imo.  ive spent somewhere around 16 hours troubleshooting this with apple  taking my first one in for a new phone  setting up a new phone for the 2nd time from scratch and  believe me im not happy about this.  ive set up twice as new  done hard boots  you name it with tech support.  and still  today i surfed facebook a bit  made a few calls totalling no more than 5 minutes.  the phone usage indicator says i used the phone for more than 5 hours impossible.  charge was at 100% this morning and with that small amount of use...really...totalling less than one hour...im at 10% battery.  while the applecare representatives are all polite and knowledgeable  i find it especially hard to stomach the scripts they are all taught to say...basically discounting the trouble you are having.  you can tell they have to say these things.  i really hope hubris doesnt undo apple  but if this iphone5 issue and the apple maps fiasco is any indicator  they are really on their way down.  i read a wall street journal article today regarding the gains amazon  samsung and google are making on apple.  i dont want to see apple fail because i really like their products.  i think they need to get a clue when it comes to not making their customers pay them to beta test.  my rate is 29.00/hr.  at that rate by my caluclations  they owe me a full refund plus some hourly wages for all the work ive put into this...and still no success.  for all my trouble i am actually going to ask them for a credit to my account and yeah you can just go on laughing...me too.  but im going to ask.  if i hadnt already passed my 4 onto my son i would take it back.  the only reason i upgraded in the first place is because i dont like using a smartphone out of warranty  too afraid of data loss.  so i went for the 5.  boo hiss apple.  in sum  heres my advice  if you have already bought one and your battery life is not good...take it back and keep taking it back until you get a good one.  make sure the battery charge is at 100% out of the box when you first charge it up.  if not  dont waste your time and ask for another phone that has a 100% charge.  there is anecdotal evidence that the ones that are not showing up in the box at 100% are the problem phones.  secondly  if you have not already taken the plunge on the iphone 5  wait 6 months until if apple resolves this problem.  the rate of poor battery reports is too high to take the risk  imo.  hope this helps   **update*** next day after talking with apple care last night and getting approval  went to the apple store today and swapped out the phone for a new one which was 66% charged out of the box.  the guy at the genius bar said he thinks its the apps i was using responsible for the battery life. i had a lot of them on my 4 and the same ones on the 5.  he said the apps may have not caught up to the new ios yet.  ill leave the discussion on who i think is to blame for that for another time.  at any rate he came up with 3 or 4 apps from the log which showed crashes.  he asked me to restore the phone from new again and rebuild it.  we left the apple store and the battery was at 66%.  we drove across the highway to another store.  before we could even go in the store the battery had gone to 61%.  we turned around and went back to the apple store in the mall.  by that time the battery was at 59%.  mind you  none of my apps were on this phone.  they had just set it up.  talked with a technician and he said it is fine to have 66% battery new in the box and that this sort of battery life loss 7% within 10 minutes was to be expected on a new phone.  he said when i charged it up again it should do better.  ok im skeptical  but will report back.  meanwhile here i go rebuilding a phone again.  one thing i can say is that at least im becoming more convinced that this is a software issue and not a hardware issue.  a combination of ios 6 and also apps that io6 no longer likes thank you apple.  also today on facebook i had two people reply to my post about this that they had new iphones and their battery was dying before the end of the day.  they were suprised at the poor battery life.  i also had a friend with a relatively new 4s say the same thing...which leads me to believe it is apples new os that is causing these problems.  my last strategy if it doesnt get better is to wipe almost all apps off the phone and just use it as a dumb phone.  with a beautiful screen.  hopefully it wont get to that point.  if i can remember to ill come back and post what happened..

404,A3VA3QI8C11D4R,2015-01-08,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,16GB,think twice before buying iphone 5.,i have been an apple user for the past 5 years. i have used iphone 4  iphone4s iphone 5 iphone 5s  apple tv  ipad 2  and ipad mini. my first apple product iphone 4 is still working. apple has changed since then especially after steve jobs. i think new products are unreliable. i am upset because i am getting ready to bury my iphone 5 because it turned off without a reason and now apple associate calls it a dead unit. i have been using it for one and half years. i took care of it very nicely. on monday it turned off randomly couple times  i restored it and it did not help either. now it is not turning on. i took it to apple store and they said that it is dead unit and out of warranty that i should have bought extended warranty. it is frustrating sincei did not use at least for two years.  if you are planing to buy iphone 5 or iphone 6  think twice. i am done with apple products  not buying iphones any more..

426,AQYN8YLGNUDGK,2013-07-11,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,16GB,the worse service ever.,i would never recommend this seller  im from ecuador and i bought an unlocked cell phone but they sent me a locked one. i contact them and explained but they said that unfortunately it has benn passed the limited time for a return or guarantee  its not fear now i have an expensive new cell phone that i will never going to use.
427,A3E18T141X32BY,2013-01-14,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,16GB,no longer the leader.,its an ok phone at best  certainly not insanely great anymore and very expensive for what you get.  battery life is poor at best  and lacks several features of similarly priced or cheaper phones that offer things like expandable storage  swappable batteries and pressure sensitive styluses.  furthermore it isnt universal so you cant easily switch carriers between lte providers and the features various carriers offer differ greatly and none is a one stop shop.  apple needs to stop worrying about making the phone thinner and lighter  and rather add innovation back to the phone like inductive charging or an all day battery..
428,A1UBL66C24Z38X,2013-01-14,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,16GB,cool.,i love the phone  is the best phone ive had   and arrived in perfect conditions i have no complaints.

458,A1DIFL0333QPEB,2012-12-03,2.0,10.0,17.0,7.0,16GB,its a great phone  but not worth upgrading from 4s.,my headline pretty much sums up my review.  this is a great phone. dont get me wrong.  the 2star rating isnt because its a bad phone.  its because apple basically did nothing to upgrade the 4s other than making it a pubic hair faster and redesigning it a bit to be slightly longer and lighter.  thats it.  the 4s is a great phone  the iphone 5 is also great  but maybe  what  2% better than the 4s its not worth it to upgrade  unless you have an iphone 3 or something.  apple is a multibillion dollar corporation for a reason.  theyre brilliant.  they could have easily have given us tons of additional features that they have in their arsenal  but decided that enough people would buy the iphone 5  based on the new design alone.  the major hardware upgrades will come with the 5s next year  when well see a 12 megapixel camera  and various other bigtime upgrades.  and guess what  people who bought the 5 will immediately buy the 5s  because this one will actually have must have features.  apples marketing and the way they mindf their customers is absolutely brilliant.  im not saying its a bad thing  its genius.  if you have a 4s  youre a sucker for getting the 5  bottom line.  shame on you if you already did.  thankfully  my wife got the 5 upgraded from a 3  that was literally falling apart  so i have had plenty of time to play around with it and form an opinion.  i will be keeping my 4s until the 5s comes out  probably this upcoming fall  and im sure the 5s will be revolutionary..

463,A3LKQ828WEDUTP,2013-01-26,2.0,5.0,9.0,4.0,16GB,dissapointed.,so i love apple first of all  i own a macbook pro  ipod touch 5th gen  and an ipad with retina display. i am by no means an android fangirl. i previously owned an lg revolution *crickets* this was like the first 4g lte phone verizon came out with about 2 years ago. so it finally crapped out and i needed a new phone  my cell provider is verizon and my plan was up in about 3 months. ive heard they do early upgrades for some extra   so i called to see if this was at all possible. apple policy does not permit the sale of their iphones before the actual date of upgrade what kind of baloney is that not at all a wise marketing strategy. the second complaint i have about this product is that i know i might get a lot of guff for this but the iphone is vastly over rated  most people solely just buy it for the label name. i have handled this device and i can say that im not impressed. the screen is extremely small  i feel it is too small for my hands and cannot imagine viewing videos or even texting on this phone. as for style goes it is the same cookie cutter design apple puts out every year  minimalistic but sleek. it is light as a feather  which depending on the user could be a good/bad thing. i dont think this phone would hold up to a drop test the same as my lg behemoth. ios 6 is perhaps the only highlight of this device  but there are much cheaper ways of getting ios 6 in your pocket  such as the ipod touch 5th generation. needless to say i will not be buying this product.  instead i am going with the samsung galaxy s3. from an apple fan i am truly disappointed that apple has put their product on a pedestal  and made it as inaccessible to the average consumer..
464,AHELPZJFP536O,2013-01-20,1.0,5.0,9.0,4.0,16GB,not unlock.,this phone is not unlock i been dealing with the att people for over a week and still fighting with them  like i said this phone is lock dont waste your  and time..
465,A3VGY4G2UF1OA,2012-11-24,3.0,5.0,9.0,4.0,16GB,worth it.,i didnt buy from amazon i bought it from apple store pick up. now heres my view i upgraded from iphone 3gs so it was worth it 1. lte loaded faster than my wifi 2. amazing camera trust me just amazing 3. better battery unless you use lte i played on this phone lasted longer than my old phone not big fan of how apple just increased the length of the phone could have made it wider too. that being said if you are on iphone 4 or 4s especially 4s do not upgrade. not worth it another thing i wonder why apple price their phone high i could get a windows laptop at that unlocked price.
466,A1CXZZVTWVYPNB,2012-11-07,5.0,5.0,9.0,4.0,16GB,the seller is enthusiastic to help..,the seller is enthusiastic to help. the phone works fine. also works fine in other countries gsm sim card. satisfied with the service and the phone. just get it if you want the unlocked one..

469,A3QV1DIEIAPUKP,2014-01-11,5.0,0.0,1.0,0,16GB,it was perfect .,i was scared to buy this at first because i looked at all the reviews but i got it in time  when i opened it  it was completely fine. i looked to check if anything was missing. the only i suspect was missing was the little book they usually give you with all the information on how to start it and how the phone works. that was the only thing i didnt find as far as i know. that scared me but the phone turned on. then i put the sim in the phone and it didnt work so i got scared that it wasnt an unlocked phone and i had been tricked but once i showed my family  they told me that there was a little platic paper in the sim hole and it wouldnt work till i pulled it out. after that was smooth sailing. the phone works perfectly .

491,ALK8QTPJQVQR9,2013-05-14,5.0,0.0,1.0,0,16GB,love the iphone.,i had never tried an apple product until about a year ago when i was playing on a friends ipad. i was so impressed i bought my own ipad 2 when the price dropped. since then ive not looked back. i now own 4 apple products.  ok ... now the iphone. i bought a 64 gb iphone in black. i highly suggest most people buy one with more that 16 gb memory. see my cons section below. i have never really loved a cell phone until now. i cant say enough good about the iphone 5. it really is an amazing device.  pros apps. apps. apps. i bank on my phone  i buy stock on my phone  i read my email on my phone  i track my running with my phone  i pay for my starbucks coffee with my phone ... all via the large array of excellent apps. ease of use. everything syncs with my ipad seamlessly. wow. my old andriod phone was regularly locking up. audio books. i check them out from my library via an app over drive media and play them through my car speakers via ford sync.  cons the price. apple makes a lot of money on these phones  but that just means consumers have to pay more. memory. 16 gb isnt enough when you consider the ios uses some of that space. then add your apps and you have limited room for music  audiobooks and such. as i mentioned  i got a 64 gb  but that goes back to the price issue. screen size. sorry apple  but you are a little behind on this one. i look forward to a 5 iphone someday ...  even with the cons i still say the iphone 5 deserves five stars..

569,A1V5HVVJHK8HQ5,2013-01-12,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,16GB,i have had better phones.,i switched from the htc evo to the iphone 5 mostly due to all the glitches in the evo and wanting to try something diff. however  after switching to the iphone  i must say that i liked my evo better. the buttons on the iphone are too small and i have skinny fingers. additionally  there are no arrows to edit a text message for example  if i misspell a word  i have to tap around the screen to move the cursor but it will only move to the beginning or end of the word. therefore  if i misspell a word i have to delete the entire word. this is annoying to me bcz i could easily correct my mistake on my evo and not have to retype the entire word. if you plan on contracting with sprint  the internet connection for the ipjone 5 is absolutely horrible bcz they are switching to the lte network  so if there is no lte connection in your area you will only get 3g and not 4g  which is like not having internet bcz the spinning loading icon will do just that all day. as a result you may not get emails for 3+ days if you only check them from your phone. i know several people across different states with the same issue. initially i could watch full episodes on vh1 from my evo but not on my iphone 5. anyway absolutely nothing stands out to me with this phone bcz in my opinion  the evo had better features and is more practical. most people who think the iphones are the best devices have likely never experienced what other phones have to offer bcz they have been on the iphone band wagon for years. i dont mean picking up a phone in a store and playing around with it  i mean actually using a different phone for months like i have. so anyone who would pay 1000s for this phone is a complete fool especially when u can just buy a computer and a better phone..

586,A1YJ2VM79EB1NT,2013-08-18,1.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,16GB,nice  but cheap and inefficient.,locked or unlocked  while this iphone has neat features and contents  it is made much cheaper than previous models.  i can go into detail about that  but first i need to mention that while the first few generations of the phone had a decent battery life of up to several days  even a week  this phone will give you about 12 to 16 hours  and thats without making calls or using data and apps.  you must carry your charging cable with you at all times or you will be faced without having a phone  per say.  in addition to that  the battery is not chargeable on its own  in other words  you cannot swap a battery and use one while the other sits and charges  in this day where android phones do provide such solutions for the on the go person that uses their phone as a business tool  this is just too hindering.  so while the phone is neat and sharp  without a competitive battery life  its useless.  and trust me  it will become frustrating over time.  another thing that has changed from earlier models  is the strength of the screen  which is now very sensitive and bound to split or shatter by means of even light impacts or pressure  such as having the phone inside your pocket or purse..
587,A13FFKMV7FNU20,2013-07-20,1.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,16GB,the iphone came with defects on the screen.,greetings  to revise the phone and put to the test i realized that the screen is defective. se l put four red stripes and other blue. is a very expensive phone  700 to have to do that every time default or i will use. thank me please solve the inconvenience  thanks.

590,A1K04PJVACQO8B,2012-12-10,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,16GB,nice but not well built.,great phone other than the fact the connection jack for the headphones is loose and not well built. if i move or touch the phone while listening to music it shuts off or crackles if it works at all. first thought it was the headphones but discovered they work in my old iphone  shame too cause the headphones are excellent quality. planning on exchanging the phone for another  hoping its just a bad egg off the assembly line. other than that no more complaints  internet is real fast compared to 3g iphone but for 700.00 bucks you would think the headphones would work .
591,A32T6BVMOMMAGQ,2012-11-26,5.0,5.0,10.0,5.0,16GB,very nice over the s3.,i tried the s3  its no where near the quality of an iphone in screen  camera and build. the s3 eventually slows down for some reason whereas the iphone stays snappy its not a huge update from the 4s because it was already a great device..
592,A15NQQ5QY2E52H,2013-01-14,1.0,20.0,35.0,15.0,16GB,not a business tool at all because email is its downfall.,this smartphone is an expensive toy  but not a business tool at all.  the problem is that there is no email flexibility that comes even close to a blackberry.  the iphones have a critical design flaw that may be done on purpose to promote the use of more data by phone carriers because of imap syncing.  1 you cannot receive gmail to both your gmail on your computer and your iphone unless you choose imap.  if you choose imap your phone always needs an internet connection to synchronize and view gmail account.  so your phone is always hunting and reloading stupidly  eating up data and slowing you down. 2 if you create a new gmail account on the iphone and have your main gmail forward to your new iphone gmail  this only takes care of incoming messages  because you cannot send as using your main gmail account.  this is unbelievable. 3 often  when we configure company emails with the iphone  the iphone will receive emails  but the iphone will not send.  this is not user error  as we checked this 30 times before stating  it here  all of our outgoing smtp servers were correct.  still not working 4 the iphone has to hunt for messages  while other superior and reliable email server systems like the blackberry rim network pushes out emails to your device nearly instantly. 5 remember for those of you who write lengthy emails  the blackberry user can type long fluent messages quickly with fewer errors and even with text assist to fix your mistypes  the iphone is super slow and frustrating for the serious typist/message writers. 6 no other alternative email clients apps can address these issues either.  bite the bullet  save the money and stay with your blackberry if you email is the most important business tool. i am giving my iphone 5 32gb to my wife and trying a samsung galaxy 2s.  if that doesnt work  i go back to the blackberry.  i cannot waste 3 days plying with iphone configurations only to find out there are no solutions because of operating system design flaws..

594,AJIDIVBILJKO0,2013-11-14,4.0,0.0,2.0,0,16GB,the 4s with a longer screen.,the 4s with a longer screen..... yea thats pretty much it. the 4s did a lot in its first year out like the whole siri thing with ios 6. where  iphone 5 just came out with a longer screen and lte. but it does have a sleaker design to it and has the faster charging port. i think i was in love with the 4s a bit more tho maybe because it was the phone that got me on the apple bandwaggon so. but i actually traded this phone for other phones for a total of 3 times  the last trade i did was for a 5csee review so yeah they arent selling these phones anymore but it was great while it lasted. eh.
595,A2JMEKYLEXUAV7,2015-01-03,5.0,0.0,1.0,0,16GB,excellent.,great quality.
596,A8J3GET1NMLG2,2013-01-09,1.0,43.0,74.0,31.0,16GB,years behind competitors still..,it is funny how some iphone supporters rave this phone with only the fact that it has a bigger screen  the earphone jack is on the bottom  wow and they also try and justify that apple is smart because they wanted to stay with a smaller screen than the competitors because it keeps it manageable with one hand and a bigger screen is not better. well partially true  but the elongated screen makes it awkward to reach the upper and lower parts of the screen with one handed operation also depending on ones hand size. so kind of an invalid argument there  but hand size dictates on both phones also. smaller screen more scrolling  harder to see  easier to use with one hand. bigger screen less scrolling  easier to see may need two hands to operate. if your are going from a smaller phone to a 5 inch screen phone  yes it does seem huge  but after having one for a while  you adapt and you dont notice it anymore and find it more more pleasant to use because the larger screen can display more.  the s4 has a 5 1/2 inch screen now but kept the body the same size as the s3.  any body larger than the s3 would be pushing the limit i believe.  the s3 fits in normal pockets with no problem  unless your wearing skinny jeans or those jeans that girls wear with tiny pockets in the back.  a 4 inch phone barely fits in those pockets.  the iphone 5 is basically the same length as the s3 but narrower.  different strokes for different folks.  battery argument isnt realistic or fare to compare between a phone with a way larger screen. apple fans claim it is the best iphone ever yeah it maybe the best iphone ever  but not by much. and it may be the best iphone  but not the best phone.  lets see..what does iphone have that others dont. bigger screen no. do a split screen and run two tasks at the same time no. wouldnt work on a 4 inch screen anyways.  customizable screen no.  and jailbreaking doesnt count.  smaller screen on the iphone without the ability to customize it makes it busy and a confusing mess with all the app. icons crammed onto the screen  and worse if you have a background set onto it to add to the mess. nicer screen not by much. also you dont really get the full use of the 4 inch display because just like the ipads  the screen dimensions are not optimized for full screen viewing of certain media. so you still get those black bars either on top or on the sides.  and not all of the iphone apps. are updated to utilize the full screen yet. another thing also is that when you surf the web  you get the settings bar displayed on the bottom of the screen also  which takes up useable screen space  unlike some phones that have dedicated keys on the bottom edge and make use of it not like the iphone where it just has one button and wastes all that space on the top and bottom. you get two thick borders  and i dont see how some say it is a nice looking phone. faster not by much where it would matter or noticeable. and that is where the majority of iphone reviewers focus on. it is only faster by a fraction of a second if that. they make it sound like it was blazingly faster than everything else and thats all they basically use as an argument and nothing else  like features. and also it is a waste of a more powerful processor and wonderful platform etc. if you cant do much on it. comes in black or white ooh really black and white drop test survival and sleekish looks most phones go into cases anyways so kind of a moot point. and most people buy the thick unattractive cases to protect their expensive iphones that make the phone a large brick that looks like it was made by nerf. it makes the iphone bulkier than a s3. memory slot to expand memory no  competitors had it for years. usb and not proprietary cable no. simple drag and drop files instead of using software no. people say that the iphone is easier to use than android how is it easier if you have to connect it to a computer to convert music and video using software all the time yes it is easier for those that buy the next generataion iphone everytime a new model comes out because it is basically the same phone as previous that you are used to using for years. if you dont like change and learning new features or having choices  then the iphone is for you. flash support no. competitors have it and you can watch everything instead of a dead spot on your web page. easily customizable screens no. swappable battery no. favorite contacts list on screen no. place the phone in sleep mode and allowing only certain calls to get through competitor had it already and you can set a time frame for it. better maps no. competitors better. although no one could beat the garminfone i had before  because it was a real gps  and it didnt need to rely on a data signal to function fully like everyone with the exception of nokia. but thats another story.  hmmm..oh wait  i know.  you can multitask now just like competitors have been able to do for years now. no  wait. that isnt it. you can only multitask with the iphone with only a few applications. like listening to the music player.  and if you want to surf the web while on a call  you can only do it through wifi depending on which carrier you have. what the heck  i paid for an expensive wonderful phone along with outrageous minutes and a data plan but i have to look for a wifi connection to use it im sorry that is not multitasking.  the android apps are pretty much caught up to iphones.  just about all the competitors use android and only iphone uses iphone apps.  same goes for tablets and even the competitors tablets offer more than the ipads.  for example the samsung galaxy s3 has everything the iphone 5 has and more. heck  you can even transfer files between the phones wirelessly  link up with compatible phones and do a presentation between the phones or beam everything onto a compatible tv  set the phone up with other compatible phones where everyone that is synced within the group to receive pictures that any of you take on the fly.  sure iphone fans will say well not everyone has a s3 and everyone has an iphone. well not true  because a lot of people are buying the s3 and the people that have the iphones do not have any of these features to enjoy.  and samsung is also selling a lot of t.vs that are compatible with the features or you can buy a converter unit to hook up to any t.v. with a usb port if need be. i have a sony google t.v. that i didnt need to do anything special to  and i can send my pictures via wifi onto the t.v. not like apple where they will change little things here and there to make you buy new hardware.  for example  the adapters. apple likes to hold back and make little upgrades to the iphone a little at a time or make a phone with a little more memory and hype it up as the next greatest innovation. this is how apple operates to get iphone die hards to keep upgrading their iphones.  going to get a lot of hate responses from iphone lovers.  just back it up with something other than some lame sarcastic remark. i am not an iphone  android  windows  samsung  etc. fan either. my daughters friends got the iphone 5 and they all either returned them or wish they did. my daughter has a samsung blaze and a lot of her friends want one also. my sister and brother in law got the iphone 4 and my brother in law returned it and got the samsung s3  and my sister wished she returned hers and got something elso also. i played with iphones and got bored with them real quick because i couldnt do much on it. yes the screen looks fantastic  but i need a phone that has functions that can make my life easier. a phone these days is your personal organizer on the go. you need something that you can customize to your personal needs for quick access to information at your fingertips. with andorid you can do this  iphone you cant. so speed to open an app. is defeated by the fact that you have to scroll though the pages of icons and find it in the mess to get to it to open it. with android you can customize your screen and apps. however you want it and this makes it way faster to open an app..
597,A2TEXWV00GIX3X,2012-10-24,2.0,29.0,51.0,22.0,16GB,still not even close to samsung galaxy s2  price is way too high.,i know a lot of apple fans are going to probably hate this review. i review a lot of products  if you check my review i try to be honest and helpful.  i am not here to be popular or go with the trend.  first  price is way to high max i would pay for iphone with the specshardwarethey have is 200 as it is not the top phone for speed  screen size  and features. i would not recommend this phone as the price does not match the quality.  you get more with the the galaxy note 2 for just a little bit more money. i am a heavy phone user. i am comparing the iphone to other phones on the market.  second  the phone is still fragile. my friend broke his within the first 2 weeks of getting the phone.  calls still dropping alot.  apple is improving a little.  bigger screen and lte but still far behind android. he is on verizon which is the best network so there is no excuse.  the screen vibrancy is not as good as the galaxy s3.  apple is improving a little.  bigger screen and lte but still far behind android. i give the iphone 5 two stars for 2 improvement.  the iphone 4 if i could give it a zero i would have.   3rd again apple is just catching up to jellybean os from android as my previous review of the iphone 4  apple has copied alot of stuff from android. people who use android will know about notification bar  cloud backup  widgets  voice navigation  voice command  4g  lte  etc the list goes on but most of these feature were from 4 years ago on android as apple has barely put it in the iphone. i also fix phone so i see these phone comes in for screen repair and also the back of the phone breaks a lot.  parts are easy to find though and there are plenty of people who repair this phone.  i use every product and test it as best as i can.  i had apple when the 2g was out which was the best phone than but apple has fallen way behind and it is showing.  as far as current sales goes samsung has taken the number one spot overtaking nokia as the number one phone manufacturer.  which i understand why because they do have the  best phone period whether is the galaxy note 2 or the galaxy s3.  phone sales galaxy series is over 380 million sold vs the iphone 4 and 5 at only 80 million..

604,A29KZN56HHV4WU,2013-01-19,5.0,0.0,2.0,0,16GB,the best phone.,my first impression of the iphone 5 when opening the box was whats the difference compared to the 4s. but in the first 5 seconds. i fell in love with it.  the screen is beautiful and the the phone is so fluid.  the size is perfect. its like the best of both worlds combining size and weight.  talk about light weight  i could put it in the same pocket as my wallet and feel no difference  i usually have a wallet pocket and a phone pocket. i live in the bahamas so we only have 3g.  this phone grabs at 3g  there is a big difference in speed compared to my 4s. i have tried the samsung galaxy s3 and got tired of it after 20 minutes.  i just dont like android its so hard to take seriously compared to apple ios  like a bad imitation. the size of screen is most perfect. its true apple did put  a lot of thought into it. lastly speed  this phone is super fast in every way from internet  wifi  games. i mean you could sit down and watch the the phone charge to 100% in i think 1015 minutes or less. the phone is a great investment. you wont be sorry..

611,A22TO6MLZDYA90,2012-11-26,1.0,18.0,33.0,15.0,16GB,the problem with apple products is apple customer service..,the problem with apple products is the absolute abismal customer care for their products. for the product price  youd expect more than to have your account disabled with no reason provided. your apple id has been disabled. thats all you get. just google it i spent hours going through the reviews of people trying to find out how to get their accounts reinstated. finally  i found the link. no number to call. i was told to reset the user name and password. done no good. work week starts. phone goes back on the backburner. try again a few days later. same results  but someone emails me back this time. tells me to go to the provided link and try again. done same result. someone else emails me. i changed my credit card info some time ago. that was it. i need to go to the itunes store and manage my account. oh. that sends me back to reset my account yet again.  i did manage to stumble across a number  finally. 1800myapple. i call it. a virtual person answers the phone. had to find my serial number.  40 minutes later  yes  i timed it  a human answers the phone. hes friendly. he confirms my serial number and apologized for my wait. apparently they can tell how long ive been on the phone too. bad news. he has to forward me to the security folkes. looks like that is going to take another 20 minutes. do i mind waiting oh. i could be grading papers or doing something productive  but why not. lets wait thats where i am now in fact ...still waiting...58 minutes and 24 seconds later...  i just dont think apple products are worth it. the apps are what makes them productive and fun  but when they cancel your account  you cant update your apps and you certaintly cant add new ones. i cant help but wonder how many people are out there whose apple products simply arent working all because the customer service is so bad. i suppose the 1 hour and 6 minutes ive been waiting now should provide a clue. my first apple repi havent spoken to the second one yet  told me theres a lot of people trying to get their accounts fixed.  by the way  if you call apple with your cell phone  make sure you plug it into your charger. otherwise  you will need to go find it around 1 hour and 10 minutes. ok  im still waiting on that second person to answer the phone  so i think i will go provide apple a few more reviews. time now 1 hour and 19 minutes...and counting..

616,A39E6ALXB9OARI,2013-01-19,1.0,3.0,8.0,5.0,16GB,disposable phone.,i went to an internet service provider store yesterday to look at the iphone 5 with the ultimate intention of buying one.  i checked what i was told there with a mac mall store.  here is what i discovered.  a chain is only as strong as it weakest link.  what is the weakest link in a cell phone  the battery.  we know it will last about two years  at which time it must be replaced.  you cannot replace an iphone battery.  the battery is an intragral part of the phone.  this is also true with other smart phone brands.  so  when the battery is dead  the phone is dead. its junk.  i was told by the mac mall store employee that apple does not replace iphone batteries.  your only option is to get a new phone.  they also told me that if i could find a battery they would replace it.  i asked where i might find one.  they had no idea.  there are apparently no after market batteries for even the 4.  as i said this situation is also true for other smart phone brands.  so  the bottom line is  iphones and others  are really very expensive disposble phones. im buying a samsung.  you can replace the battery. if this story doesnt bother you  than enjoy your new disposable smart phone.  every two years.  maybe theres something to be said for that if you like new things..

629,A11GTOQM3LN5OS,2013-01-09,2.0,0.0,4.0,0,16GB,no bluetooth compatability.,do not buy an iphone 5 if you use the bluetooth in your car.  for many new car models you can make outgoing calls but will not be able to accept incoming calls via bluetooth  apple has the ethical obligation to tell you that their product will not function in a lot of cars when the customer is considering a purchase....but they dont.  very disappointed that they did not share this information i would not have made this purchase.
630,A3N77MW49UIXNL,2013-05-04,1.0,2.0,8.0,6.0,16GB,iphone 5 dissapointing.......,the ios needs a major upgrade  every native app that comes with the iphone has been outdone by a thirdparty developer. for example  camera+ is better than camera  google maps is undoubtedly better than apple maps which was a complete mess  google now is better than siri. google now has everything ready for you before you ask it a question. the phone literally has the same functionality as the two previous releases if you just download the ios 6 upgrade. this upgrade will make your iphone 4 or 4s have just as much internet speed and battery life as the iphone 5. its literally the same thing   just a quarter of an inch smaller.in case you didnt know  americans have spent 6 billion dollars fixing their iphones since its first release in 2007. get ready to see that number go up because the new iphone is more fragile than chris bosh. the iphone 5 is thinner and longer and with all laws of physics considered  that means it has more of a probability to break. siri was cool for about a week and a half after its release on the iphone 4s. if you ask any iphone user  they will tell you they barely use it because she gives you wrong information after mishearing just about every command. siri hasnt gotten much smarter in the iphone 5  still bombarding the user with facts and figures you werent even looking for. remember those good old days when you could walk into any place whether it be a restaurant or a friends apartment and  almost be sure you will be able to charge your phone the same charger that worked for various apple products also conveniently could charge every type of iphone. we are sad to report that those days are over  as apple decided to change the size of the connector that the charger plugs into on the bottom of the phone. now  the standard apple charger that fit every phone for the past five years no longer fit into the iphone 5. these things make the iphone terrible..
631,A23S1YJKGCQTZ6,2013-01-03,1.0,2.0,8.0,6.0,16GB,best iphone ever.... but.,apple once again created a stunning device which is better than the iphone generations before. but there is a problem. because of the hd cam inside the photos and videos are gigantic and need a lot of space on your phone. so trust me and take this version [...].
